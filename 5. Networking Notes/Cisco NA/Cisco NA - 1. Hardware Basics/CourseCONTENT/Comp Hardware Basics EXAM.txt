Networking Basics EXAM


Question 1
Which two computer components require separate cabling for power? (Choose two.)


wireless network adapter

USB keyboards

done
case and CPU fans

done
internal SATA hard drives

USB flash drives
Case and CPU fans, and internal hard drives require separate power cabling from the motherboard. Wireless network adapters, keyboards, and USB flash drives do not require separate power connections.

Question 2
Which three PC desktop functions are typically provided on the front panel and must be connected to the motherboard? (Choose three.)


network activity light

done
PC power button

done
drive activity light

done
USB connectors

USB connectors, PC power button, and drive activity light are the most common PC front panel functions. If available, the network activity light, CPU temperature indicator, and audio power button are not typically located on the front panel of the computer.

Question 3
When a PC is being assembled, which component is connected to the motherboard with a SATA data cable?


the power supply

done
the internal solid-state drive

the video card

the network interface card
Internal SSD and HDD storage drives connect to the motherboard with a SATA data cable. Video cards and network interface cards connect to the motherboard through expansion slots. The power supply does not usually have a data connection to the motherboard.

Question 4
Which statement describes the proper use of an anti-static wrist strap?


An anti-static wrist strap should not be used in conjunction with an antistatic mat.

For optimum grounding, the clip should be attached to a painted section of the computer case.

done
An anti-static wrist strap should make contact with the skin.

The anti-static wrist strip should not be attached to any grounded object.
ESD can cause permanent damage to electrical components. An anti-static wrist strap must be worn and grounded when working on a PC. Computer case paints may not be conductive and thus it is better to ground the bare section of a computer case.

Question 5
What is the purpose of thermal paste being applied to the top of the CPU when the heatsink and CPU fan are being installed?


done
to improve the transfer of heat from the CPU to the heatsink

to ensure that the heatsink adheres to the CPU

to make it easier to remove and clean the heatsink

to simplify aligning the heatsink and fan with the mounting screws
The application of thermal paste to the top of the CPU improves the transfer of heat from the CPU to the heatsink.

Question 6

2. Align the heat sink and fan assembly retainers with the holes on the motherboard.
3. Place the correctly aligned CPU gently into the socket.
4. Tighten the fan and heat sink assembly retainers to secure the assembly in place.
5. Connect the assembly power cable to the CPU fan connector on the motherboard.
The CPU must be securely installed in its socket on the mother board before the thermal paste is applied, the heat sink and fan assembly is installed, and the fan is connected to the CPU fan power connector on the motherboard.

Question 7
Refer to the exhibit. Which type of expansion slot is shown?


AGP

PCI

PCIe x16

close
memory

Question 8
Which component requires a technician to install screws externally through the PC case?


RAM

CPU

motherboard

done
power supply
The power supply commonly has four screws that attach from outside the case through case holes into screw holes on the power supply.

Question 9
What are three important considerations when installing a CPU on a motherboard? (Choose three.)


done
Antistatic precautions are taken.

done
The CPU is correctly aligned and placed in the socket.

The CPU contacts are first cleaned with isopropyl alcohol.

done
The CPU heat sink and fan assembly are correctly installed.

The CMOS EPROM battery is removed prior to installing the CPU.

Maximum insertion force is applied to the load lever so the CPU is locked in place.
The CPU is sensitive to static discharges. Its pins are very delicate and it works at high temperatures, so precautions must be taken. If the CPU has been used in another machine or if the fan is being replaced, you might need to remove the old thermal compound using isopropyl alcohol (not on the CPU contacts). The battery does not need to be removed from the motherboard during the CPU installation. This would cause the saved BIOS settings to be lost. Minimum force should be needed to lock the CPU load lever into place.

Question 10
Which statement describes the purpose of an I/O connector plate?


done
It makes the I/O ports of the motherboard available for connection in a variety of computer cases.

It plugs into the motherboard and expands the number of available slots for adapter cards.

It provides multiple connections for SATA hard drives to connect to the motherboard.

It connects the PCIe adapter slots used for video directly to the CPU for faster processing.
The I/O plate connects to the back of the case and has holes for each of the ports on the motherboard to push through, allowing the motherboard to be used in many different cases regardless of the number of ports on the board or their layout.

Question 11
Why are SODIMMs well suited for laptops?

Smartwatches are a type of wearable that includes a microprocessor, a special operating system, and apps. Sensors in the smartwatch can gather data about various aspects of the body and use Bluetooth to report this information back to another device, such as a smartphone. Some smartwatches can also connect directly to a cellular network, serve as convenient displays for notifications from apps, can include GPS location services, and the ability to store and play music and playlists.

Question 25
Which scenario or situation would prevent a user from upgrading the OS on an Android device?


done
The hardware does not meet specifications.

The correct patches were not installed.

Permission was not obtained from the manufacturer.

The software copyright was not obtained before the installation.
Because there are so many different Android operating systems and mobile devices, there are updates and patches for each device. Sometimes, a new version of Android will not install on older devices where the hardware does not meet the minimum requirements. These devices may receive patches to fix known issues, but will not receive an operating system upgrade. Operating systems updates and patches for Android use an automated process for delivery. When a carrier or manufacturer has an update for a device, the update will appear as a notification on the device.
