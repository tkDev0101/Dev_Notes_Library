Question 1
Match the tabs of the Windows 10 Task Manager to their functions.

 - Performance		- 
 - Startup		- 
 - Services		- 
 - Details		- 



Question 2
A technician notices that an application is not responding to commands and that the computer seems to respond slowly when applications are opened. What is the best administrative tool to force the release of system resources from the unresponsive application?

 - Task Manager
 - Use the Task Manager Performance tab to see a visual representation of CPU and RAM utilization. This is helpful in determining if more memory is needed. Use the Applications tab to halt an application that is not responding.


Question 3
Which two commands could be used to check if DNS name resolution is working properly on a Windows PC? (Choose two.)

 - nslookup cisco.com
 - ping cisco.com
 - The ping command tests the connection between two hosts. When ping uses a host domain name to test the connection, the resolver on the PC will first perform the name resolution to query the DNS server for the IP address of the host. If the ping command is unable to resolve the domain name to an IP address, an error will result.

Nslookup is a tool for testing and troubleshooting DNS servers.


Question 4
What would be a reason for a computer user to use the Task Manager Performance tab?

 - to check the CPU usage of the PC
 - The Performance tab is commonly used to check current computer performance. Two key areas that are shown are memory and CPU usage.


Question 5
A technician has installed a third party utility that is used to manage a Windows 7 computer. However, the utility does not automatically start whenever the computer is started. What can the technician do to resolve this problem?

 - Change the startup type for the utility to Automatic in Services.
 - The Services console in Windows OS allows for the management of all the services on the local and remote computers. The setting of Automatic in the Services console enables the chosen service to start when the computer is started.


Question 6
What are two advantages of the NTFS file system compared with FAT32? (Choose two.)

 - NTFS provides more security features.
 - NTFS supports larger files.
 - The file system has no control over the speed of access or formatting of drives, and the ease of configuration is not file system-dependent.


Question 7
A PC user issues the netstat command without any options. What is displayed as the result of this command?

 - sudo
 - chmod
 - pwd


Question 9
What is the outcome when a Linux administrator enters the man man command?

 - The man command is short for manual and is used to obtain documentation about a Linux command. The command man man would provide documentation about how to use the manual.


Question 10
What term describes a set of software tools designed to increase the privileges of a user or to grant access to the user to portions of the operating system that should not normally be allowed?

 - rootkit
 - A rootkit is used by an attacker to secure a backdoor to a compromised computer, grant access to portions of the operating system normally not permitted, or increase the privileges of a user.


Question 11

ls –l analyst.txt
-rwxrw-r-- sales staff 1028 May 28 15:50 analyst.txt

 - read, write, execute
 - The file permissions are always displayed in the User, Group and Other order. In the example displayed, the file has the following permissions:
	 • The dash (-) means that this is a file. For directories, the first dash would replaced with a "d".
	 • The first set of characters is for user permission (rwx). The user, sales, who owns the file can read, write and execute the file.
	 • The second set of characters is for group permissions (rw-). The group, staff, who owns the file can read and write to the file.
	 • The third set of characters is for any other user or group permissions (r--). Any other user or group on the computer can only read the file.

 • HTTP is used for web traffic data and is considered insecure.


Question 18
A user wants to synchronize some apps, movies, music, and ebooks between mobile devices. What are the two types of connections used to synchronize this type of data? (Choose two.)

Question 20
A traveling sales representative uses a cell phone to interact with the home office and customers, track samples, make sales calls, log mileage, and upload/download data while at a hotel. Which internet connectivity method would be a preferred method to use on the mobile device due to the low cost?

 - Wi-Fi
 - Mobile devices typically use either the cellular network or a Wi-Fi network to connect to the internet. The Wi-Fi connection is preferred because it uses less battery power and is free in many places.


Question 21
Which cellular technology supports speeds up to 20 Gbps?

 - 5G
 - Cellular technology standards are 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE, and 5G. 5G technology supports speeds up to 20 Gbps and is more efficient.

Question 24
What are two potential risks that could result from rooting or jailbreaking a mobile device? (Choose two.)

 - not properly creating or maintaining sandboxing features
 - enabling app access to the root directory
 - Rooting and jailbreaking mobile devices allows customization of the OS which enables user and app access to the root directory. In addition, rooting and jailbreaking may cause a device to not properly create or maintain sandboxing features. Both of these can create security risks to the device. The three incorrect options are all considered potential benefits of rooting and jailbreaking mobile devices



Question 25

Android apps run primarily based on privileges enabled by the user. Sometimes an Android app requires extra privileges to access system components. How do Android apps run to accomplish both situations?

 - Android apps run in a sandbox.
 - Android apps run in a sandbox and have only the privileges enabled by the user. If an app needs to obtain permissions, a prompt will appear and the user can grant permissions through settings.


Question 28
Which statement describes the Touch ID in iOS devices?

 - It is the hash value of the user fingerprint.
 - Apple uses a technology known as Touch ID in which the user sets up a template fingerprint scan that is converted into a unique hash and stored within a secure cache on the iOS device. The hash is used to authenticate with the user.


Question 29
What is the purpose of running mobile device apps in a sandbox?

 - to prevent malicious programs from infecting the device
 - Mobile device apps are run in a sandbox that isolates them from other resources. Bypassing the phone carrier from preventing access to unauthorized apps is jailbreaking or rooting the device.
