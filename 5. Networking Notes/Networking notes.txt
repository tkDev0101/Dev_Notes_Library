Networking notes

Use these in collab with prompt engineer

and cisco NA notes and make notes on Networking stuff




To develop the practical skills you listed, you need a structured plan that combines hands-on labs, certifications, and mini-projects across systems, networking, cloud, and scripting. Here's a breakdown of what to do for each skill‚Äîwith practical exercises and tools to help you upskill effectively.

Explore AWS free tier: set up RDS, S3, EC2

‚úÖ 7. VM Networking & Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
What to Learn:
Virtual switches (vSwitch, OVS), network overlays (VXLAN)

SDN controllers like OpenDaylight

Practical Exercises:
Use Open vSwitch (OVS) to create virtual networks between VMs

Explore Mininet to simulate SDN topologies

Connect virtual NICs and simulate packet flow

‚úÖ 8. Data Center & Server Platforms
What to Learn:
Rack organization, cable management, power redundancy

Servers from Dell, HP, Cisco UCS, etc.

Practical Exercises:
