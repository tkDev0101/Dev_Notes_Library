üéâ Another Step Forward on My DevOps Journey! üéâ

I'm excited to share that I‚Äôve completed the Cisco Networking Academy - Operating Systems Basics course and earned my Certificate of Completion & Badge! üèÖ

This course helped me strengthen my foundational knowledge of operating systems‚Äîincluding Windows, Linux, mobile OS, and essential topics like security, network configuration, and device connectivity.

This achievement is part of my ongoing learning path toward becoming a DevOps Engineer, where a strong understanding of operating systems, cloud platforms, and automation is crucial.

Proud to keep growing and building skills in DevOps, Cloud Computing, and Azure!
