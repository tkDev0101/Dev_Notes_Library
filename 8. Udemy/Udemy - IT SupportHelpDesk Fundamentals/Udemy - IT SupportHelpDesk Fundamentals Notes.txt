3 categories of OS system
 - desktop
 - server
 - mobile operating systems


Hardware
 - Motherboard
 - CPU
 - Storage
 - RAM
 - Powersupply


----------------------------------------

Common issues of:  

Motherboard
 - Power surge damage
 - Damaged or broken Pins


CPU
 - CPU Running at 100%
 - Overheating


Storage
 - Dead hdd - data can be extracted from dead hard drives
 - Data corruption

Magnetic
 - HDD
Transistor(no moving parts, quite)
 - SSD
 - Flash Drive

Optical
 - CD/DVD/Blue-ray


RAM
 - Dislocated ram
 - Power surge damage
 - beeping sound when computer turns on



----------------------------------------
Power Supply
 - converts incoming AC to low voltage DC power
 - Power ratings - 200-1800W
 - Overheating
 - Dead PSU
 - Damaged/noisy fans


----------------------------------------

BIOS / UEFI
 - Are firmware that directly interact with hardware
 - above hardware- below OS
 - software that comes preloaded with the motherboard
 - comes pre-mstalled on a chip on the motherboard

Firmware
 - low level software handling hardware instructions
 - provided by hardware manufacturer


BIOS/UEFI
 - First software that runs when hardware runs
 - wakes up the hardware components and ensures that hardware is functioning properly
 - Instructs loading of OS
 - Used to change boot order
 - Switch UEFI/legacy(BIOS) Boot
 - enable virtualization 

BIOS( Basic Input Output System)
 - gen 1 firmware standard


UEFI
 - gen 2 firmware standard

Network Analogy

Suburb = Network
External Ip Adrs = Town
Router = Post shop
Switch = Postman
Computers = Houses
Internal IP Adrs = House name
MAC Address = Street Number
computer Apps = Person in house

Subnetting
Subnets - Subnets are sub-networks. Subnet defines the allowed IP addresses in a network. It can be thought of as a boundary wall for allowed IPs in your network. Subnets are either

represented in decimal format or in CIDR notation.

Finally, a device applies a subnet mask to its own IP address to check if one particular IP is part

of its own local subnet.
