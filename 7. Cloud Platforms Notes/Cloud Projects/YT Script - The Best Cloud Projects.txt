 - Tech with Lucy

Hi everyone! üëã As a cloud learner, one question you may have is: "How do I document my projects"? 

In this video, I share 3 of the best ways to showcase your cloud projects and get hired. If you find this type of content, please let me know in the comments below! ‚¨áÔ∏è

Introduction
0:00
hey everyone this is Lucy and in this
0:02
video we're going to be covering a
0:03
highly requested video topic which is
0:05
how to document your AWS Cloud projects
0:07
many of you who are learning AWS know
0:09
that cloud projects are a great way to
0:11
build your technical skills but the
0:13
question that often comes up is how do
0:15
you showcase these projects when
0:17
applying to a job well there are a few
0:19
ways to do this and here are the three
0:21
methods we'll be covering in today's
0:22
video the first one is by showcasing
0:24
your projects on a personal portfolio
0:26
website the second one is by creating a
0:28
GitHub repository for your projects and
0:30
the third one is by using social media
0:32
platforms like medium and Linkedin for
0:34
each of these I'll provide step-by-step
0:36
instructions on how you can get started
0:37
as well as some examples of how other
0:39
people have used these methods to
0:41
document their Cloud projects let's get
Method 1
0:43
into it so method number one is to
0:45
document your Cloud projects through a
0:47
personal portfolio website this is one
0:49
of the most common ways to Showcase your
0:50
projects because it will not only help
0:52
you build a personal brand but also
0:54
maximize your chances of getting hired
0:56
into a cloud role you can kind of think
0:57
of a portfolio website as the central
0:59
place for you to store and Link
1:01
everything together this could include
1:03
your resume AWS Cloud projects as well
1:05
as any blog articles you've written
1:07
pretty much anything that can help
1:09
showcase your skills and experiences for
1:11
instance if you create a 3T web
1:13
application on AWS you could include a
1:15
project section in your portfolio and
1:17
document it there but at this point some
1:19
of you might be thinking okay Lucy what
1:21
exactly do you mean by document what are
1:24
the key components I should include well
1:26
it's really up to you because there's no
1:27
one correct way of doing this but what I
1:30
would recommend is to start by writing a
1:31
summary of what you built the steps you
1:33
took and what services used you could
1:35
also include an architectural diagram
1:37
and any screenshots of the process and
1:40
if you want to go a step further one
1:41
more option is to create a YouTube video
1:43
to demonstrate how the application works
1:45
the main point is to make sure the
1:47
documentation is clear and easy to
1:49
understand okay let me show you some
1:50
examples I came across where people have
1:52
added Cloud projects to their portfolio
1:54
so this first example is from adita
1:57
pretama he's a site reliability engineer
1:59
based in Indonesia and does a really
2:01
good job at showcasing all of his
2:03
experiences in cloud and it if we click
2:06
on the project section you can see that
2:07
a data has created a list of personal
2:09
projects that he's worked on in the past
2:11
let's take a look at this AWS serverless
2:13
web application project so in this
2:16
article there's a little introduction
2:17
section explaining why the project was
2:19
built and if we scroll down a bit more
2:22
we can see the diagram of the
2:24
architecture and the services used this
2:26
is Then followed by a step-by-step
2:28
summary of how the project was built so
2:30
that if someone were to try and build
2:31
the exact same project they'll be able
2:33
to follow along the instructions I'll
2:35
leave a link down below if you'd like to
2:37
check out adita's website and let's move
2:39
on to another example of a portfolio
2:41
website this next example is a portfolio
2:44
website created by Marika Bergman Marika
2:47
is a freelance full stack developer and
2:49
on her website she documents her AWS
2:51
Cloud projects and certification badges
2:53
in the project section she highlights
2:55
two technical projects one of them being
2:57
the cloud resume challenge if we hover
2:59
over the box you can see that she has a
3:01
blog post about the project as well as
3:03
the front end and back end of the
3:05
projects stored on GitHub let's take a
3:07
look at her blog post about the cloud
3:09
resume challenge so similar to the
3:11
previous example Marika also shares some
3:13
context on why she decided to build the
3:15
project and she also included an
3:17
architectural diagram of what she built
3:19
but what I really like about this post
3:21
in particular is that she takes more of
3:24
a personal approach and talks about
3:25
things that she found challenging for
3:27
example having to choose between a rest
3:29
API and a HTTP API to create your own
3:32
portfolio website I'll recommend using a
3:34
website builder instead of trying to
3:36
build it from scratch so that you can
3:37
hover up and running much faster let me
3:39
show you a quick demo of how to get
3:41
started so I'm using hostinger one of my
3:44
favorite web hosting platforms and if
3:45
you click on the link below you'll be
3:47
able to get a special discount on their
3:49
annual subscription okay let's click on
3:51
claim deal and here I'd recommend going
3:53
with the premium web hosting option this
3:55
one lets you create up to 100 websites
3:57
and also provides you with a free custom
3:59
domain which I find quite useful let's
4:01
click add to cart and choose a period
4:03
I'm going to choose the 48 month option
4:06
since it offers the best value and also
4:08
because I want my websites to be up and
4:09
running in the long term and before you
4:12
make the purchase remember to use the
4:13
code Tech with Lucy in this coupon code
4:15
section over here to get an even bigger
4:17
discount now once you've signed up
4:19
you'll see this hostinger dashboard and
4:21
the option to claim your free domain I'm
4:24
going to type in Lucy awsproject.com and
4:27
you can choose any domain name you'd
4:29
like check for the availability and
4:31
complete registration cool so now I'm
4:34
ready to build my portfolio website and
4:36
what's really great about hostinger is
4:38
that they now have an AI website builder
4:40
option so you can just type in what
4:42
website you need and they will generate
4:44
something that's tailored to what you're
4:45
looking for okay so here I'll type in
4:48
personal portfolio website for AWS
4:51
projects
4:52
awesome so here's the website they
4:54
generated and I can customize it to make
4:57
it look exactly the way I want if you'd
4:59
like to build your own website using
5:00
hostinger you can head to hostinger.com
5:02
forward slash Tech with Lucy to get a
5:04
limited time discount on all the yearly
5:06
plans but yeah overall I'd highly
5:08
recommend building a portfolio website
5:10
because it would not only help you keep
5:11
track of everything you built but also
5:13
make it easier for you to present your
5:15
projects to potential employers the
Method 2
5:17
second way to document your AWS Cloud
5:19
projects is by using GitHub GitHub is
5:21
widely used in the tech industry and is
5:23
a great way to document your AWS card
5:25
projects now instead of walking you
5:27
through the stages of creating a GitHub
5:28
account and storing your projects let me
5:31
show you a great example of one so here
5:33
we have the GitHub page of verbal Junior
5:35
devops engineer if we click on the
5:37
repositories tab you can see that he has
5:39
a repository named AWS projects where he
5:42
stores a copy of all the cloud projects
5:44
that he has worked on there's five Cloud
5:45
projects in this repo for example one of
5:48
them is a data migration project and
5:51
another is a web app project let's take
5:53
a look at the web app project folder and
5:55
see what's inside Okay cool so Robo has
5:58
created a web application for an example
6:00
organization called Holden school and
6:02
has packaged up his project in a cloud
6:04
formation template he included the
6:06
architectural diagram as well as
6:07
detailed instructions on how to
6:09
configure the project if you'd like to
6:11
check out the rest of his GitHub repo
6:13
I'll leave a link to it in the
6:14
description below now the third way to
Method 3
6:16
document your AWS Cloud projects is by
6:18
leveraging platforms like medium and
6:20
Linkedin this is one of my favorite ways
6:22
that I've seen people document the AWS
6:24
Car Projects because with those
6:25
platforms you can reach a broader
6:27
audience which then of course may lead
6:28
to more job opportunities similar to the
6:31
previous two methods I would recommend
6:32
including a description of the project
6:34
the AWS Services you used as well as any
6:37
relevant diagrams or screenshots and
6:39
again don't shy away from discussing any
6:41
challenges you faced and how you tackled
6:43
them here's an example of someone who
6:45
followed one of my YouTube tutorials and
6:47
published a LinkedIn article to document
6:48
it so this article is written by Sachin
6:51
ADI and he talks about how he visualized
6:54
data with Amazon quickside and Amazon S3
6:56
at the very top of the article we can
6:58
straight away see the architectural
7:00
diagram and as we scroll down a bit more
7:02
we can find a step-by-step walkthrough
7:04
with screenshots to Showcase every stage
7:06
what I like about his screenshots is
7:08
that they provide extra detail through
7:10
red boxes and numbers and what that does
7:12
is it shows people what exactly they
7:14
need to click on at each step alright
Cloud Resume
7:16
something we haven't covered in this
7:17
video yet is how to add Cloud projects
7:19
onto your resume this is a cloud
7:21
computing resume template that I've
7:23
shared in previous videos and I'll
7:25
include a link to it in the description
7:26
below but as you can see here all you
7:29
really have to do is include the name of
7:31
your project and a short description of
7:33
what you built you could also include a
7:35
hyperlink to your GitHub or portfolio
7:36
page in order to provide more details so
7:39
there you have it three effective ways
7:41
to document your AWS Cloud projects and
7:43
build a strong portfolio if you found
7:44
this video helpful please remember to
7:46
give it a like and as always I'll see
7:48
you in the comments below alright bye
7:50
for now

2. The Best Cloud Projects To Get Hired For Beginners
	- Tech with Soleyman

Intro
0:00
best way to get hired as a cloud
0:02
engineer is by building Cloud projects
0:05
now what are the best cloud projects to
0:07
build this a question that I get asked
0:09
all of the time and one that I'm going
0:11
to answer in this video now most
0:13
beginners just build a random Cloud
0:16
projects they have no relevancy to what
0:19
they are learning the method that you
0:21
want to use to build Cloud projects and
0:23
get hired as a cloud engineer is called
0:26
the cloud Mac model now I know what
0:29
you're thinking what on Earth is the
0:31
cloud Mac model don't worry I'm going to
0:34
explain this in a second the truth is
0:36
that passing a cloud certification is
0:38
not going to get you hired in fact Cloud
0:41
certifications are pointless if you have
0:44
no practical hands-on experience because
0:47
being a cloud engineer is all about
0:49
building projects for clients to get
0:51
hired you have to follow the cloud Mac
0:54
model now I've been working in the cloud
Certifications
0:56
for the past 7 years and I work for
0:59
myself myself as a freelance Cloud
1:01
engineer and I hold the solution
1:03
architect associate and the solution
1:05
architect professional AWS
1:07
certifications and I can tell you with
1:09
ease that these certifications did not
1:12
help me secure jobs it's actually my
1:15
practical and project experience that
1:18
took me further to get multiple job
1:21
offers therefore I always suggest not
1:23
wasting your time passing foundational
1:25
certifications that give you no hands-on
1:28
experience and as a beginner looking to
The Cloud Mac Model
1:30
break into the cloud you have to focus
1:33
on building Cloud projects now I'm going
1:36
to share the best cloud projects to get
1:38
hired for cloud Engineers but before I
1:40
do that you should check out my weekly
1:43
Cloud newsletter where I share free
1:45
resources tutorials boot camps and so
1:48
much more to help you make your Cloud
1:50
move so what is the cloud Mac model this
1:54
model is the way to actually build
1:57
projects and get hired not only am I
1:59
going to tell you what this model is but
2:01
I'm also going to give you the seven
2:03
best cloud projects to build as a cloud
2:06
engineer to get hired and trust me once
2:09
these interviewers see the projects that
2:11
you've built they will hire you in no
2:14
time now being a cloud engineer means
2:16
that you work across the board and you
2:18
mix and match different skills together
2:20
from cloud architecture cicd infrastruct
2:24
code server management networking
2:27
security and more you are the back of
2:30
all trades and you can do it all it's
2:32
obviously going to take time for you to
2:34
be able to do all of this but you need
2:35
to start somewhere therefore you have to
2:38
build a portfolio of projects that are
2:40
more than just beginner friendly and
2:41
expose you to these different Cloud
2:44
Concepts and tooling so take that into
2:46
account and here are the projects that
2:48
you should build now the cloud Mac model
2:50
is focused on building Cloud projects
2:52
you want to think and design how you can
2:54
use different cloud services together to
2:56
build Solutions this is what you would
2:58
do within your cloud engineer job
3:01
working with customers when you are
3:02
starting out focus on the breadth of
3:05
services to build projects so you can
3:07
get exposed to as many cloud services as
3:10
possible and then be able to connect
3:13
them together the cloud Mac model is all
3:15
about putting into practice the theory
3:18
that you are learning don't just watch
3:20
tutorials start right away using what
3:23
you've learned and apply them to
3:25
projects and just for Simplicity as I
3:28
have an AWS background I'm I'm going to
3:30
focus these Cloud projects onto AWS but
3:32
they are applicable for all Cloud
3:34
platforms some of these projects are
3:37
Advanced and I don't expect you to be
3:38
able to complete them but you just have
3:40
to try and see how far you can go to
3:43
building more complex projects because
3:45
you will learn a lot more doing the hard
3:48
things than the other advice out there
3:50
on YouTube which is to host a static
3:53
website using the console that's
3:55
something you will never do as a cloud
3:58
engineer working in an actual job one of
Cloud Architecture
4:01
the best projects to always start with
4:03
is an architecture focused project
4:05
architecture is simply the most
4:07
important part of any project it's the
4:09
floor plan of the solution that you're
4:12
building it breaks down the different
4:13
components and layers of the problem
4:16
that you're solving using cloud services
4:19
a great Cloud architecture project to
4:21
work on is designing a highly available
4:23
and scalable architecture that can host
4:26
a web application like a react app you
4:29
also want to add a database layer that
4:31
your react app interacts with firstly
4:33
you want to research into what makes a
4:35
cloud architecture highly available and
4:37
scalable and then you want to apply
4:39
those Concepts into your architecture
4:41
the best part of cloud architecture is
4:43
there's no one site fit Source solution
4:46
you can design an architecture for a web
4:48
application in so many ways using lots
4:51
of different AWS services for example
4:53
you first need to think about the
4:55
networking layer and then your
4:56
application layer and then your database
4:59
layer I also recommend documenting every
5:02
single project that you're working on
5:04
and using it to Showcase all future
5:06
employers and there are so many design
5:08
tools that you can use to build this
5:10
Cloud architecture I use exal draw and
5:13
it's my go-to for any Cloud design work
Cloud Infrastructure
5:16
the next Cloud project that you should
5:17
build to get hired as a cloud engineer
5:20
is getting started and building with
5:22
infrastructures code tools like
5:24
terraform this is because for all
5:27
upcoming projects I'm going to share you
5:29
you do not want to click and create the
5:31
cloud services on the cloud console
5:34
everything you build needs to be via
5:36
code and terraform is the most popular
5:38
infrastructur code tool out there this
5:41
will help you prepare for your actual
5:43
job and develop your handson Cloud
5:46
engineering skills with infrastructures
5:48
code you can repeatedly and reliably
5:50
deploy entire infrastructures without
5:54
manual errors for beginners this
5:56
consistency is invaluable ensuring that
5:59
you can can recreate environments for
6:01
testing and learning without any
6:03
discrepancies one of terraforms standup
6:05
features is its ability to work across
6:08
various Cloud platforms AWS gcp and
6:13
Azure for beginners this means that they
6:15
can learn one tool but apply their
6:17
knowledge across multiple Cloud
6:19
environments making them more versatile
6:21
as Cloud Engineers although I recommend
6:24
picking AWS cloud and building
6:26
infrastructure with terraform onto that
6:28
cloud infr structure is complex and
6:30
there are hundreds of services available
6:33
but having a structured code driven
6:35
approach to provisioning and managing
6:37
infrastructure is a game changer and I
6:40
recommend First Learning terraform
6:42
syntax and then looking at how to use it
6:45
and apply it with AWS and making use of
6:48
the most common AWS services like VPC S3
6:53
ec2 and I am now if you want to get
6:55
started with the cloud and become a
6:57
cloud engineer then you should check out
6:59
my cloud engineer handbook where I'll
7:02
provide you with a structured way of
7:04
learning projects to build and guiding
7:07
you to go from zero to Cloud engineer
7:10
hero covering the fundamentals tools
7:12
Technologies to learn and become a cloud
7:15
engineer through texts diagrams and
7:18
short videos right now it's a 50%
7:21
discount for pre-order so move fast
7:24
before the actual launch price I drop
Networking Layer
7:26
the link in the video description below
7:27
the next Cloud project that you should
7:29
be able to get hired as a cloud engineer
7:31
is creating a networking layer using
7:33
terraform networking is the backbone of
7:36
any Cloud infrastructure by setting up a
7:39
VPC subnet and routing you're
7:41
essentially building the foundational
7:43
layer upon which all the other cloud
7:46
services operate on and demonstrating a
7:48
solid understanding of these
7:50
fundamentals is vital for any Cloud
7:52
engineering role using terraform to
7:54
script and manage your networking layer
7:57
reinforces the principles of
7:59
infrastructure as code this shows
8:01
employers that not only do you
8:03
understand Cloud networking but you also
8:05
know how to manage it as code which is a
8:07
well- needed skill in the modern Cloud
8:10
engineering world the networking layer
8:12
will be part of your Cloud architecture
8:14
in Project one therefore you can then go
8:17
ahead and build it with using
8:19
infrastructures code for example for
8:21
this project you want to build a VPC
8:24
create availability zones Define free
8:26
subnets in each availability Zone update
8:29
the rotables to allow communication
8:31
between the subnets and finally when you
8:34
deploy your ec2 or your beant stalk
8:37
service you can also update the security
8:40
groups for those instances Now by
8:42
defining free subnets in each
8:44
availability Zone you're essentially
8:46
setting up the structure that supports
8:48
High availability and fault tolerance
8:50
this reflects your understanding of
8:52
Designing robust and resilient Cloud
8:54
infrastructures now the next Cloud
Web Application
8:56
project that you should build to get
8:58
hired as a Cloud engineer is deploying a
9:01
web application and you can do this
9:03
using the AWS elastic beant stalk
9:06
service which automates the process of
9:08
deploying scaling and managing web
9:10
applications and services whilst elastic
9:13
beant stalk abstracts a lot of the
9:15
underlying infrastructure you still get
9:18
exposed to various AWS services like ec2
9:22
RDS S3 and cloudwatch under the hood
9:25
giving you a real taste of the AWS
9:28
ecosystem you can create a simple react
9:31
app boiler plate and deploy it onto
9:33
beant don't forget to create the beant
9:35
stalk service with terraform and not
9:38
using the AWS console this project is a
9:41
nice intro into hosting applications on
9:44
AWS and it's one of the ways that you
9:46
can do this the next Cloud project that
9:49
you should build to get hired as a cloud
9:51
engineer is containerizing an
9:53
application containerization has become
9:55
one of the most core ways to ensure
9:58
consistent environment IR Ms from
9:59
development to production by packaging
10:02
your application and its dependencies
10:04
into a container you're essentially
10:06
creating a portable unit that you can
10:08
run reliably across multiple Computing
10:12
environments now the good thing is you
10:13
can just containerize your react app
10:16
using Docker and just deploy it onto AWS
10:19
containerization carries many principles
10:21
of cloud engineering values efficiency
10:24
consistency repeatability and
10:26
scalability as Cloud platforms continue
10:28
to evolve it's clear that containers
10:31
will be a big part of how applications
10:33
are developed deployed and managed in
10:36
the cloud therefore working with
10:37
containers is key as a cloud engineer
10:39
and this is a slightly Advanced project
10:42
but don't worry when you getting started
10:44
as a beginner you want to get familiar
10:46
with as much as possible and practice
10:48
your Hands-On Cloud skills now the next
10:51
Cloud project that you should build is a
10:53
big part of a cloud engineer role and
10:55
that is building a cicd pipeline now
10:58
there are many many cicd pipeline tools
11:01
that you can use such as genkins gitlab
11:04
GitHub actions and I'm most familiar
11:06
with GitHub actions and AWS code
11:09
pipeline for this project you want to
11:10
create a continuous integration and
11:12
continuous deployment pipeline that
11:14
automates to build the test and the
11:16
deployment process for your application
11:19
using GitHub actions and AWS code
11:21
pipeline again you can just use your
11:23
react app and build a cicd pipeline to
11:27
deploy it onto your beant stalk server
11:29
in AWS cicd is crucial for software
11:32
development teams allowing them to
11:33
automate test and deploy and resting a
11:36
quicker and more reliable releases
11:39
learning how to set up cicd Pipeline
11:41
with AWS and gearhub actions is highly
11:44
valuable for cloud Engineers working in
11:46
cloud and software environments the next
Text to Speech
11:49
Cloud project to get hired as a cloud
11:51
engineer is a text to speech converter
11:54
using AWS Lambda and AWS poly a powerful
11:58
textto speech conversion service this
12:00
project allows you to create an
12:02
application that can transform written
12:05
text into natural sounding spoken audio
12:08
in multiple languages and voices
12:11
developing a text to speech converter is
12:13
not only valuable as a skill but also a
12:16
feature in high demand for modern
12:18
applications and websites learning the
12:20
capabilities of AWS Lambda and AWS poly
12:23
provides you with hands-on experience
12:25
using AI powered services for practical
12:28
application
12:29
Lambda is also super popular and I think
12:32
the future of cloudware applications AWS
12:35
Lambda is also one of the most common
12:37
services and a service that I see being
12:40
used in almost every single project that
12:43
I've worked with and it's super cool and
12:45
a serverless AWS service and one that
12:49
you should definitely get familiar with
12:51
the next Cloud project to get hired as a
12:53
cloud engineer is a cloudbased chatbot a
12:56
chatbot is an AI software that can
12:58
simulate a conversation with users in a
13:01
natural language just like how we are
13:03
speaking right now by using AWS Lex
13:06
you'll be creating a chatbot that can
13:08
recognize the intent of the user's input
13:10
and respond appropriately AWS Lex
13:13
actually provides a deep learning
13:15
functionality of automatic speech
13:17
recognition for converting speech to
13:19
text now once you've created your chat B
13:21
you can actually integrate this into a
13:23
website mobile app or other platforms
13:25
using the AWS cdk now creating a chat
13:28
what introduces you to the concepts of
13:31
AI and ml especially in the realm of
13:34
natural language processing for a cloud
13:36
engineer understanding how these
13:38
Services work is crucial as Ai and ml is
13:42
rapidly growing in the cloud remember
13:44
this will be a difficult project but
13:46
even attempting this is a credit to you
13:49
and you should document how you've done
13:50
it also don't get discouraged if you
13:52
can't finish it you want to throw
13:54
yourself in the deep end and see how far
13:57
you can go building Cloud projects now
13:59
those were the seven Cloud projects to
14:02
get you hired as a cloud engineer drop a
14:04
comment below which project that you're
14:06
doing first and as always thank you so
14:08
much for watching and I'll see you on
14:11
the next
