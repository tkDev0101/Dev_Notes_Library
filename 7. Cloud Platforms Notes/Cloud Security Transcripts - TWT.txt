The Best Cloud Security Projects To Get You Hired FAST (2025)

In this video, I reveal The Best Cloud Security Projects that will get you hired fast in 2025. 

0:00
more than 95% of cloud security
0:02
engineers are building the wrong
0:04
projects I know this because I used to
0:06
think a static website built on Amazon
0:08
S3 would get me hired until I discovered
0:11
exactly what hiring managers are
0:14
actually looking for in 2025 I'm Slay
0:16
Man I've worked in tech for a decade and
0:18
I've built my own AI cloud security
0:20
consultancy and through my academy I've
0:22
helped over 400 students learn cloud and
0:25
AI with my first principles blueprint
0:27
for engineers And in this video I'll
0:29
reveal the best cloud security projects
0:32
to get you hired fast Starting with
0:34
project number one secure file vault
0:37
When you're working in a team and you're
0:39
sharing sensitive financial and client
0:41
information there's always that nagging
0:43
concern unauthorized access What happens
0:46
when files get into the wrong hands
0:48
damaged reputation potential fines and
0:51
loss of client trust So what's the
0:54
approach that actually delivers results
0:57
let me show you how I approach security
0:59
from first principles So when I have a
1:01
problem or I'm trying to build an actual
1:03
solution for a client I always ask what
1:06
are we trying to accomplish here we want
1:10
information flowing between authorized
1:12
parties whilst keeping everyone else out
1:14
Now to ensure we achieve this we have to
1:17
address three fundamental questions What
1:20
exactly are we protecting who should
1:22
have access and how does the access
1:25
change over time this leads us to three
1:28
requirements that will form the core of
1:30
our project Your sensitive files need
1:32
proper encryption This is a
1:34
non-negotiable Using Amazon S3 with
1:36
serverside encryption it means that your
1:38
data remains protected even if other
1:41
security layers fail If someone somehow
1:44
accesses the underlying storage they'll
1:46
face encrypted data that it can't
1:48
interpret I found that that is typically
1:50
where most security breaches happen
1:52
You'll need to verify who someone is So
1:54
the authentication and what they are
1:56
allowed to see the authorization AWS
1:59
services like Cognito handle the
2:00
verification process while IM policies
2:03
enforce the lease privilege principle
2:05
giving people access only to what they
2:08
absolutely need Now when these controls
2:10
work together you get a system that's
2:12
both secure and functional Now without
2:14
visibility into who's accessing what and
2:16
when you don't have complete security
2:19
Crowd records every action creating a
2:21
reliable record of all file interactions
2:24
This visibility means you can detect
2:26
unusual patterns and respond quickly to
2:28
potential issues Now let's build a
2:30
secure file sharing portal Starting with
2:32
step number one creating an S3 bucket
2:35
with serverside encryption This is
2:36
specifically designed to handle
2:38
sensitive documents whilst maintaining
2:41
high availability And when we enable
2:43
serverside encryption with AWS KMS keys
2:46
we are adding a critical protective
2:48
layer Every file uploaded to our system
2:50
automatically gets encrypted before it
2:52
even lands on the storage media Users
2:55
don't even notice that this happens The
2:57
encryption is completely transparent to
2:59
them And the beauty of this approach is
3:01
that our files remain protected at rest
3:04
until an authorized user needs them and
3:06
at that point only then the system will
3:09
decrypt them for legitimate access Now
3:11
with our storage foundation secure we
3:13
now focus on controlling who can access
3:16
what This is where we design IM roles
3:18
that match our organization's structure
3:20
creating specific profiles for viewers
3:22
who only need to read documents editors
3:25
who need to make changes and
3:26
administrators who manage the overall
3:28
system Now each role is carefully
3:30
crafted to provide only the permissions
3:33
absolutely necessary for that specific
3:36
job function We take it a step further
3:38
by scoping these permissions to specific
3:40
folders or file types whenever possible
3:43
Now for extra added security we could
3:44
implement IM conditions that can
3:46
restrict access based on factors like
3:48
time of the day IP addresses or whether
3:51
the user is using multiffactor
3:53
authentication And as our team evolves
3:56
we audit and update these permissions to
3:58
ensure they remain appropriate But that
4:00
is not enough We also need a way to
4:02
reliably verify who's accessing our
4:05
system We'll use Amazon Cognito to
4:07
implement a registration flow for users
4:09
Cognito handles all the complex identity
4:12
verification and will enable
4:14
multiffactor authentication for that
4:15
crucial extra layer of security And when
4:18
users log in Cognito doesn't just grant
4:20
the access it issues temporary
4:22
credentials that are specifically
4:24
aligned with their IM role These
4:26
credentials only work for resources
4:28
they're authorized to access and
4:30
automatically expire after a short
4:32
period And this creates a seamless yet
4:34
highly secure authentication process
4:36
that's difficult for attackers to
4:38
compromise Now that our security is in
4:40
place we have to design a clean
4:42
interface that brings all of it together
4:45
If it's hard to navigate nobody will use
4:47
it And when users want to upload new
4:49
files a simple drag and drop area makes
4:52
it effortless And as they work with
4:54
documents all downloads happen through
4:56
pre-signed URLs that verify permissions
4:59
before allowing access Now if they need
5:02
to share a document with a colleague
5:03
they can do so through a permission
5:05
management system that clearly shows who
5:08
has access to each file So we can use
5:11
AWS Amplify to host our UI So our web
5:14
interface which is beautifully
5:15
integrated with Cognito and S3 to build
5:18
this because our users need to see where
5:20
they're dragging their files to
5:21
Something to think about is that cloud
5:23
security isn't just about prevention
5:25
It's also about visibility That's why in
5:27
step five we implement Cloud Trail to
5:29
record every single action that happens
5:32
with our S3 objects So when someone
5:34
uploads downloads or even shares a file
5:37
we capture who performed that action
5:40
exactly when it happens and where they
5:42
were connecting from These logs are
5:44
stored securely in their own dedicated
5:46
bucket where they can't be tampered with
5:48
And we set up automated alerts that
5:50
trigger when suspicious patterns emerge
5:52
For example someone downloading an
5:55
unusual number of files or accessing the
5:57
system at 3 or 4:00 a.m Our system will
6:00
also perform regular log analysis to
6:02
help identify normal access patterns
6:05
versus potential security incidents We
6:07
also ensure our logs are retained
6:10
according to compliance requirements
6:11
creating an audit trail that we might
6:13
need in the future Now there's an
6:15
overlooked cloud security risk that we
6:18
have to address Data that stays in your
6:20
system for too long That's why we in
6:22
step number six will set up a data life
6:25
cycle by defining retention periods
6:27
based on both sensitive and business
6:29
needs Once we have these policies in
6:31
place S3 life cycle rules automatically
6:34
move older files to cheaper storage
6:36
tiers to optimize for cost And when
6:39
files reach the end of their retention
6:41
period our system will automatically
6:43
delete them reducing both storage costs
6:45
and also potential compliance issues Now
6:48
for regulatory requirements we can
6:50
implement special handling for files
6:52
that need longer retention periods And
6:54
the system provides regular reporting on
6:56
the status of data across its life cycle
7:00
and verifies compliance with retention
7:02
policies This way we ensure that data
7:05
doesn't live forever reducing both the
7:07
cost and the risk over time Can you see
7:10
how when you set out the core
7:12
requirements for a problem and then
7:13
break it down to first principles you
7:16
create a system where each component has
7:18
a clear purpose and delivers real
7:21
benefits And most importantly your
7:23
entire solution directly addresses real
7:25
business needs rather than theoretical
7:27
threats And when you think about cloud
7:29
security in this way it becomes a
7:31
competitive advantage and businesses
7:34
will desperately want your expertise And
7:36
that's not the only critical cloud
7:38
security challenge that businesses face
7:40
today Because in modern cloud
7:42
environments the sheer volume of
7:43
resources like S3 buckets EC2 instances
7:47
databases and way more creates a
7:50
specific problem Manually tracking all
7:52
security configurations is impossible So
7:55
project number two we're going to build
7:57
the cloud security scout But first we
7:59
have to approach the problem from first
8:02
principles And again we have to ask the
8:05
questions what are we really trying to
8:07
achieve at its core we want to ensure
8:10
that every single resource in our cloud
8:12
environment adheres to our security
8:14
baseline regardless of who created it or
8:17
when they created it And we can't just
8:19
set it and forget about it It has to be
8:21
continuously monitored because resources
8:23
are being created and modified all of
8:25
the time in our cloud environments Next
8:27
let's set our core requirements for this
8:30
project And this time we have four And
8:32
starting with number one comprehensive
8:34
discovery which just means finding all
8:36
resources across your environment
8:38
because you can't secure what you don't
8:40
know This discovery process must be
8:42
automated and thorough identifying
8:45
resources across all accounts Number two
8:47
consistent evaluation We have to ensure
8:50
that each resource is checked against
8:52
the same security baseline every single
8:54
time and we'll set this baseline
8:56
ourselves And number three timely
8:58
protection The window between a
9:00
misconfiguration appearing and being
9:02
exploited can be remarkably short
9:04
sometimes just a few hours So we have to
9:08
shrink that window of vulnerability by
9:10
detecting issues quickly And finally
9:12
requirement number four prioritize
9:14
remediation This is like triaging We
9:16
have to focus attention on the highest
9:19
risk issues first Not all security
9:21
findings are equal Some represent
9:23
immediate threats whilst others are more
9:25
theoretical risks Now here is how we're
9:28
going to build it Starting with step
9:29
number one identifying the high impact
9:32
vulnerabilities Examples of this include
9:34
S3 buckets that allow public reads or
9:36
rights security groups that open
9:38
critical ports to the entire internet
9:40
and RDS databases lacking encryption at
9:42
rest It's very simple Here we are
9:44
applying the Pareto principle to
9:46
security Roughly 20% of security issues
9:49
will represent 80% of your risk By
9:51
focusing on high impact vulnerabilities
9:53
first you get the most security
9:55
improvement for your initial effort And
9:58
this is the first principle thinking in
10:00
its essence What problems would have
10:02
caused the most damage if exploited Next
10:05
we can leverage AWS Lambda to run our
10:07
security checks without having to manage
10:09
any servers Using Python and the AWS SDK
10:13
we write the code that systematically
10:14
examines our cloud resources For
10:17
instance when checking S3 you want to
10:19
list all your buckets and examine their
10:21
access control policies to see if they
10:23
are public For security groups you want
10:25
to list every rule and look for rules
10:27
allowing inbound traffic from the
10:29
internet on sensitive ports For RDS you
10:31
want to verify that each database is
10:33
encrypted at rest Now having programming
10:35
checks in this way ensures consistency
10:38
and scalability We don't want to do this
10:40
manually This way we're directly
10:41
addressing the discovery and the
10:43
evaluation requirements ensuring nothing
10:46
is missed due to human error For step
10:48
three as you know by now cloud security
10:50
isn't something that we just fix once
10:52
It's an ongoing process So we're going
10:55
to use Amazon Event Bridge to schedule
10:57
our Lambda function to run automatically
10:59
at regular intervals like every day at 2
11:02
a.m And if a new misconfiguration
11:04
appears we'll discover it really quickly
11:07
after each scan Step number four will
11:09
store the results in DynamoB This lets
11:11
you track the changes over time and then
11:13
from there you might notice over time a
11:16
particular team repeatedly opens up port
11:18
22 to your entire internet You can then
11:21
send them to highlight trends and
11:22
educate the team on the most secure
11:25
approaches Now this gets you in the
11:26
mindset of not treating cloud security
11:28
incidents in isolation but instead
11:30
you're identifying reoccurring problems
11:32
across the business From first
11:34
principles you are acknowledging that
11:36
security improvement requires
11:38
understanding and not just what's gone
11:40
wrong but why it keeps happening Now
11:42
with security issues that are urgent
11:44
such as an open database port accessible
11:46
to just anyone step number five means we
11:48
are going to integrate SNS or Slack
11:51
notifications to alert security teams By
11:53
prioritizing these alerts we make sure
11:55
that the most severe risk are addressed
11:58
immediately directly addressing one of
12:00
our four core requirements Prioritize
12:02
remediation From first principles we
12:04
understand that not all risks are equal
12:07
So a tiered alerting approach ensures
12:09
critical issues are fixed straight away
12:11
Now with the automated assessment tools
12:13
set up is that all well no because in
12:16
step number six we now have to iterate
12:18
and expand with new checks For example
12:20
you might look for IM users who lack
12:23
multiffactor authentication or you might
12:25
verify that EBS volumes are encrypted
12:28
Now this iterative approach starting
12:30
with the biggest risks and then
12:31
expanding is a direct application of
12:34
first principles thinking Address the
12:36
basics first then refine and extend your
12:39
coverage as you gain confidence in your
12:41
automation Here we are acknowledging
12:43
that the perfect cloud security is
12:45
impossible from day one By starting with
12:48
high impact issues and gradually
12:49
expanding you create a sustainable
12:51
improvement process rather than an
12:54
overwhelming project that tries to do
12:56
everything at once You have to see cloud
12:58
security as a continuous journey and not
13:01
a destination So this project will help
13:03
you get hired fast because it shows you
13:05
that you can do way more than just
13:07
follow basic rules You understand what
13:09
really matters for security in your
13:11
cloud setup And most importantly you
13:13
understand why And as cloud services
13:15
change you can easily adapt your
13:17
security approach So instead of checking
13:19
security once in a while by hand i.e
13:22
manually You've made it an automatic
13:25
ongoing process that keeps up with fast
13:28
development Your system finds problems
13:30
evaluates them consistently catches
13:32
issues quickly and helps fix the most
13:35
important things first And in 2025
13:38
companies are continuing to adopt
13:40
containerbased applications which means
13:42
they are packaging their software into
13:44
units called containers using
13:46
technologies like Docker or Amazon ECS
13:49
These containers run consistently across
13:51
any computing environment allowing for
13:54
seamless deployment to the cloud But
13:56
here is the problem They often
13:58
prioritize speed and portability at the
14:00
expense of security And when you
14:02
consider that 87% of container images
14:04
contain at least one high or critical
14:07
vulnerability Container security
14:08
obviously shouldn't be an afterthought
14:10
So we're going to build project number
14:12
three the container security falcon But
14:14
first we have to understand container
14:16
security at its core And again applying
14:19
the first principles and stripping away
14:21
the complexity there is two essential
14:23
areas that we have to focus on Verifying
14:25
what goes into the container image and
14:27
restricting what the container can do
14:30
once deployed in the cloud Now there is
14:32
four core requirements for this project
14:34
Number one we want to minimize the
14:36
attack surface which means including
14:38
only what's necessary in your container
14:40
to reduce total number of
14:42
vulnerabilities Number two the principle
14:43
of lease privilege ensures containers
14:46
run with only the permissions that they
14:48
need to function and nothing more What
14:50
this does is that it limits the damage
14:52
an attacker can do if they compromise a
14:54
container Number three verification
14:57
before deployment This ensures that
14:59
we're catching vulnerabilities before
15:01
containers reach to production and in
15:03
front of live customers And number four
15:05
runtime protection and monitoring
15:07
provides visibility into container
15:09
behavior allowing you to detect and
15:12
respond to suspicious activity quickly
15:14
So we begin our secure container journey
15:16
at the most fundamental level the
15:18
container image itself A Docker file
15:20
starts with a base image And our first
15:23
choice here is crucial for security We
15:25
select the smallest possible base image
15:28
often the Alpine Linux or Alpine Linux
15:30
if you're into Formula 1 which is less
15:31
than 5 megabytes and contains far fewer
15:34
potential vulnerabilities than larger
15:36
alternatives Next we configure
15:37
application to run as a non-root user
15:39
inside of the container By the way root
15:41
access gives total privileges and
15:43
control in a system So if an attacker
15:46
manages to exploit our application
15:47
without root access many attack
15:49
techniques become more difficult or
15:51
basically impossible to execute And we
15:54
also carefully audit every package and
15:56
dependency and we add it to the
15:58
container The attack service of our
16:00
container would directly correlate with
16:02
its contents The less we include the
16:04
more secure our container becomes With
16:06
our minimized container image built we
16:08
move on to step number two storing and
16:10
analyzing it securely Amazon Elastic
16:12
Container Registry or ECR provides a
16:15
managed service specifically designed
16:16
for container images After building our
16:18
image locally we push it to ECR where
16:21
it's stored with encryption at rest ECR
16:24
has built-in image scanning which
16:25
automatically checks our image against a
16:28
database of known vulnerabilities CVEes
16:31
And if our base image contains a
16:33
critical security flaw the scan report
16:35
identifies it immediately This gives us
16:37
the opportunity to fix these issues
16:39
before the container ever reaches a
16:41
production environment So rather than
16:42
expecting developers to stay current on
16:44
all security advisories affecting their
16:47
dependencies which is an impossible task
16:49
given the volume automated scanning
16:51
provides consistent verification This
16:53
verification step embodies the security
16:55
principle of trust but verify We trust
16:58
developers to write secure code but we
17:00
verify that their dependencies don't
17:02
introduce any known vulnerabilities Now
17:05
what individual security steps are good
17:07
a comprehensive cloud security approach
17:09
requires connecting these steps into a
17:12
consistent automated workflow So step
17:14
number three we'll use AWS code pipeline
17:17
to help us stitch together each stage
17:19
retrieving code from our repository
17:20
building the Docker image scanning for
17:22
vulnerabilities and finally deploying to
17:25
production And the real benefit here is
17:27
that every time a developer pushes new
17:29
code these stages run automatically
17:32
ensuring no one forgets critical
17:34
security steps like vulnerability
17:37
scanning So if code pipeline detects
17:39
serious security issues at any stage it
17:41
halts the process completely preventing
17:43
insecure containers from reaching
17:44
production environments where they could
17:47
be exploited In our for container passes
17:49
all security checks Step number four we
17:51
need to deploy in a way that maintains
17:52
our security posture Amazon Elastic
17:54
Container Service ECS orchestrates how
17:57
many container instances run and where
18:00
they are deployed In ECS we define tasks
18:02
that specify not just the container
18:04
image but the precise resources and
18:06
permissions it requires This is where we
18:08
implement the principle of lease
18:10
privilege at the deployment level We
18:12
assign an IM role to each task granting
18:15
it only the permissions necessary for
18:17
the application specific functions And
18:19
if our application doesn't need to read
18:21
from Dynamo DB for example we explicitly
18:24
exclude that permission and we only give
18:27
access to what it needs And if it only
18:29
needs to write logs to cloudatch but not
18:31
read them we will configure exactly that
18:33
by limiting privileges in this granular
18:35
way Even a compromised container has
18:38
dramatically narrower set of actions
18:40
that it can perform So we've deployed
18:43
our containers securely Is that it well
18:46
no Step number five we need ongoing
18:49
visibility AWS Cloudatch captures logs
18:51
from our containers in real time If an
18:53
application suddenly starts logging
18:55
unusual errors experiencing a sharp
18:57
increase in CPU usage we can investigate
19:00
immediately And this early detection of
19:01
unexpected behavior helps us identify or
19:04
respond to potential security incidents
19:06
before they can cause significant damage
19:08
This creates a security feedback loop
19:10
allowing us to continuously improve our
19:12
defenses based on observed behavior and
19:15
real world attack patterns Step number
19:17
six with our secure pipeline in place
19:19
our work isn't done It's just actually
19:20
the beginning of a new phase So once our
19:23
basic pipeline is operating smoothly we
19:25
continuously refine and enhance it We
19:28
might implement stricter scanning rules
19:30
as a security maturity increases or
19:32
integrate more specialized third-party
19:35
tools for deeper static code analysis
19:37
And perhaps we add container runtime
19:39
security monitoring that can detect
19:41
unusual behavior patterns that might
19:43
indicate an intrusion attempt The first
19:45
principal idea here is to continually
19:48
limit the containers attack service and
19:50
improve our ability to monitor its
19:52
behavior And as we identify new
19:54
vulnerabilities or security gaps through
19:56
our monitoring or through industry
19:57
advisories we update our pipeline to
20:00
enforce newly identified best practices
20:03
So security is never done It evolves as
20:06
threats and technologies change A
20:08
container security pipeline isn't just a
20:10
one-time project but a continuous
20:12
improvement process So can you see how
20:14
approaching container security from
20:16
first principles you create multiple
20:19
layers of protection each step with
20:21
minimal images non-root users
20:23
vulnerability scanning automated
20:25
pipelines lease privilege deployments
20:27
and continuous monitoring addresses a
20:29
fundamental security requirement We are
20:32
integrating security throughout the
20:34
container life cycle and not as an
20:36
afterfall and that mentality will get
20:38
you hired fast in 2025 Now to build
20:41
these projects that I've mentioned
20:42
you'll want to know all of the skills
20:44
that a cloud security engineer needs So

What does a Cloud Security Engineer ACTUALLY Do?

In this video I share, what a Cloud Security Engineer really does and why they earn $134,398+ per year! From securing cloud environments to protecting Fortune 500 companies, this comprehensive guide breaks down the daily responsibilities, required skills, and incredible career opportunities in cloud security. 


0:00
what does a cloud security engineer
0:02
actually do now I've been in the tech
0:05
industry for a decade and it's allowed
0:07
me to work with Fortune 500 companies
0:10
startups government organizations
0:12
architecting and implementing
0:14
multi-million dollar Cloud Solutions I
0:16
now run my own cloud security business
0:20
helping startups build more securely on
0:22
the cloud through governance compliance
0:25
security engineering and Dev setups but
0:27
here's the thing the demand for cl
0:30
security Engineers is skyrocketing with
0:33
the adoption of cloud Technologies and
0:35
the increasing threats of cyber
0:37
criminals businesses are Desperately
0:39
Seeking for skilled professionals who
0:42
can keep their Cloud environment safe
0:44
and secure in fact the average Cloud
0:47
security engineer earns over
0:50
$134,000 and I'm confident that you can
0:52
achieve the same level of success but
0:55
it's not just about the money this role
0:57
offers incredible job satisfaction
1:00
knowing that you are playing a critical
1:02
part in protecting an organization from
1:05
cyber threats and in this video we'll
1:07
dive into the day-to-day task of a cloud
1:10
security engineer we're going to explore
1:12
the skills that you need to succeed in
1:14
this role discuss the incredible
1:16
salaries that you can expect and take a
1:18
look at the future job outlook for this
1:21
in demand career path now before we get
1:23
started you should check out my weekly
1:25
Cloud newsletter where I share free
1:27
resources tutorials boot camps and so
1:29
much much more helping you with your
1:31
Cloud move and also smash that like
1:33
button and subscribe if you haven't
1:34
already because I'm so close to hitting
1:37
100,000 subscribers now this video is
1:39
super long so to help I've done you a
1:40
massive favor and created timestamps for
1:43
you to skip around if you want to now
1:45
before you learn and understand what
1:47
cloud security engineering is I think
1:50
it's important for you to get a view of
1:52
the bigger picture a step back and how
1:55
Cloud security fits into cyber security
1:57
and Cloud engineering you see cloud
2:00
security engineering is like a subset or
2:02
a specialized area that falls under both
2:05
cyber security and Cloud engineering
2:07
it's the point where these two domains
2:09
intersect and work together to protect a
2:12
company's assets in the cloud cyber
2:14
security as you might know it's all
2:16
about protecting computer systems
2:18
networks and data from digital attacks
2:21
unauthorized access and other security
2:24
threats it involves a wide range of
2:26
practices tools and Technologies to keep
2:28
an organizations digital assets safe now
2:31
on the other hand Cloud engineering is
2:33
about designing building and managing
2:36
systems that applications run on cloud
2:38
computing platforms such as AWS
2:41
typically Cloud Engineers are
2:43
responsible for architecting and
2:44
implementing scalable reliable and coste
2:47
effective Cloud Solutions and when you
2:49
bring together these two domains you get
2:52
Cloud security engineering it's a
2:54
specialized area that focuses on
2:56
securing the systems data and
2:58
applications that live in the cloud
3:01
cloud security Engineers apply the
3:03
principles and best practices of cyber
3:05
security to the unique challenges and
3:07
opportunities presented by cloud
3:09
computing and think of it like this if
3:12
cyber security is about protecting
3:13
digital Assets in general and Cloud
3:15
engineering is about building and
3:17
managing systems in the cloud then Cloud
3:19
security engineering is about protecting
3:22
those specific cloud-based systems and
3:24
assets and here is how these three areas
3:27
coexist and work together cyber security
3:30
provides the overall framework
3:32
principles and best practices for
3:34
protecting digital assets from threats
3:37
it defines security protocols policies
3:39
and processes that organizations should
3:42
follow to mitigate these risks where
3:45
Cloud engineering leverages the power
3:47
and flexibility of cloud computing to
3:49
design and build scalable resilience
3:51
systems Cloud Engineers Architects
3:53
solutions that take advantage of cloud
3:56
capabilities whilst also considering
3:59
factors like cost optimization and
4:01
performance Cloud security engineering
4:03
brings the principles of cyber security
4:06
into the context of the cloud it adapts
4:09
and applies security best practices to
4:11
the unique characteristics of cloud
4:13
environments Cloud security Engineers
4:15
work to ensure that the systems and data
4:18
in the cloud are protected from
4:20
unauthorized access data breaches and
4:22
other security threats specific to cloud
4:25
computing in practice this means that
4:28
cloud security engineers collaborate
4:30
closely with both cyber security and
4:32
Cloud engineering teams they work with
4:35
cyber Security Professionals to Define
4:37
and Implement security controls policies
4:39
and incident response plans tailored to
4:42
the cloud and at the same time they
4:44
partner with Cloud Engineers to design
4:47
and build secure Cloud architectures
4:49
Implement Security Solutions and ensure
4:52
that security is integrated through the
4:54
development and deployment process for
4:57
example a cloud security engineer might
4:59
work work with the cyber security team
5:01
to Define identity and access management
5:03
policies ensuring that only authorized
5:05
users can access sensitive data and
5:08
systems they would then collaborate with
5:10
Cloud Engineers to implement these IM
5:13
policies using the native Security
5:15
Services of platforms such as AWS im a
5:18
cloud security engineer might also work
5:20
with cyber security team to develop a
5:22
data classification and protection
5:25
strategy categorizing data based on its
5:27
sensitivity and defining incred ion and
5:30
access control requirements they would
5:32
then partner with Cloud Engineers to
5:34
implement the data protection Solutions
5:36
such as encrypting data at rest using
5:38
aws's Key Management Services such as
5:41
KMS fundamentally Cloud security
5:44
engineering is a critical area that
5:47
brings together the world of cyber
5:48
security and Cloud engineering it
5:50
ensures that the benefits of cloud
5:52
computing is realized while also
5:55
maintaining security and the Integrity
5:58
of an organization's digital Assets Now
6:00
by working at the intersection of these
6:02
two domains Cloud security Engineers
6:05
play a key role in protecting a
6:07
companies's data and systems in the
6:09
cloud and the reason that I love Cloud
6:12
security is that you get the best of
6:14
both worlds cyber security and Cloud
6:17
engineering all right so let's dive into
6:20
the day-to-day task of a cloud security
6:22
engineer and I've broken these down into
6:24
four key areas tasks Technologies
6:27
operations and projects and we going to
6:29
cover the most common and important
6:31
parts of these areas because otherwise
6:34
this video wouldn't finish until 2025
6:37
starting with the task now as a cloud
6:39
security engineer one of your key tasks
6:41
is to conduct regular security Audits
6:44
and assessments of your Cloud
6:45
environment this involves reviewing
6:47
security configurations identifying
6:49
potential vulnerabilities and ensuring
6:52
compliance with industry standards and
6:54
best practices Now by examining your
6:56
Cloud infrastructure you can uncover
6:59
areas for improvement and then develop
7:01
strategies to strengthen the overall
7:03
security posture another crucial task is
7:06
threet modeling and risk assessment this
7:08
process involves analyzing your Cloud
7:10
architecture identifying potential
7:13
attack vectors and assessing the impact
7:15
of potential security breaches by
7:18
understanding the unique risks facing
7:20
your environment you can prioritize
7:22
security efforts and Implement targeted
7:25
controls to mitigate those risks this
7:27
proactive approach helps you stay one
7:30
step ahead of potential threats Cloud
7:32
security Engineers are also responsible
7:34
for developing and maintaining
7:36
comprehensive security policies and
7:38
procedures this includes creating
7:40
guidelines for secure configuration of
7:42
cloud resources defining Access Control
7:44
policies and establishing incident
7:47
response plans now by documenting and
7:49
enforcing these policies and procedures
7:52
you ensure a consistent and robust
7:54
security approach across your
7:56
organization all right so those were the
7:57
three common tasks but let's dive into
7:59
some of the Technologies and tools a
8:01
cloud security engineer uses now as a
8:04
cloud security engineer you need to be
8:06
confident with a wide range of AWS
8:09
Security Services this includes services
8:11
like AWS identity access management also
8:14
known as IM for Access Control Amazon
8:16
virtual private Network VPC for network
8:19
security AWS Key Management Service KMS
8:22
for encryption key management and Amazon
8:24
guard Duty for fret detection now
8:27
understanding how these Services work
8:29
together to provide a layer security
8:31
approach is essential of course there's
8:33
some more Security Services but I don't
8:35
want to cover everything for you cuz
8:37
that would be just so long and too much
8:39
information now in addition to the AWS
8:41
native Services Cloud security Engineers
8:44
also need to leverage third-party
8:46
security tools to enhance their security
8:49
capabilities one tool is Sneak who have
8:52
kindly sponsored this video sneak is a
8:54
developer First Security platform that
8:56
integrates with AWS to help you secure
8:59
for your applications and infrastructure
9:01
sneak offers a range of features that
9:04
complement and extend AWS Security
9:06
Services for example you can use sneak
9:08
to scan your code dependencies
9:10
containers and infrastructures code for
9:12
vulnerabilities sneak also works well
9:15
with your existing tools like your idees
9:18
clis repositories pipelines Docker Hub
9:21
and the best part is how sneak
9:23
integrates well with your AWS
9:25
environment and services such as code
9:28
pipeline allowing you to automatically
9:30
scan your code as part of your cicd
9:33
workflow it also works well with Amazon
9:35
ECR elastic container registry enabling
9:38
you to scan your container images for
9:41
vulnerability and get recommendations
9:43
for base image upgrades and what's
9:45
amazing about my partnership with sneak
9:48
who have actually been a long-term
9:49
sponsor here on the channel is that you
9:52
can play around with sneak for yourself
9:54
and find out if there's any
9:56
vulnerabilities affecting your Cloud
9:58
projects and if you sign up using my
9:59
link sak.com man you can use sneak for
10:03
free forever another powerful feature of
10:06
sneak is its ability to detect
10:08
misconfigurations in your AWS cloud
10:11
formation templates and terapon files
10:13
but identifying insecure configurations
10:16
before they're deployed sneak helps you
10:18
prevent potential security issues from
10:20
ever reaching your production
10:22
environment and affecting your customers
10:24
now with sneak you can also leverage
10:25
Amazon event bridge to set up real time
10:28
notification and response workflows
10:31
based on sneak security findings this
10:33
allows you to quickly respond to
10:35
potential threats and vulnerabilities
10:37
minimizing the risk of security
10:39
incidents now whether I'm working on my
10:42
own personal projects or any client
10:44
projects I always add sneak into the mix
10:47
as I know it can help me build more
10:48
secure platforms for my clients and if
10:51
you want to use sneak go click the link
10:52
in my bios. co/ slman and you sneak for
10:56
free forever thanks again for sneak for
10:59
being an amazing partner for our Channel
11:01
another technology and tool that you
11:03
need to be comfortable with as a cloud
11:05
security engineer is of course
11:06
infrastructures code such as terraform
11:09
and cloud formation by defining your AWS
11:11
infrastructure as code you can ensure
11:14
consistent and secure deployments and
11:16
easily manage changes over time IAC
11:19
allows you to Version Control your
11:21
infrastructure enabling you to track
11:23
changes and roll back if needed okay so
11:26
those were the tasks and Technologies
11:28
covered but another big part of a cloud
11:31
security engineer role is of course
11:33
operations continuous monitoring is
11:36
essential for detecting and responding
11:38
to security incidents in your Cloud
11:39
environment Cloud security Engineers can
11:41
of course use tools like AWS guard Duty
11:44
or security Hub and even Cloud watch for
11:47
monitor for suspicious activity un aized
11:49
access attempts and potential
11:51
vulnerabilities when an incident happens
11:53
you'll need to follow an established
11:55
incident response plan that contains the
11:58
Fret investigates the root cause and
12:00
Implement remediation measures it's all
12:02
about taking action with a plan that can
12:05
help prevent any more attacks now
12:07
managing access to AWS resources is
12:09
another critical operational task for
12:12
cloud security Engineers this involves
12:14
implementing the principle of lease
12:16
privilege ensuring that users and
12:18
applications have only the permissions
12:20
that they need to perform their tasks
12:22
you'll work with tools like AWS IM to
12:25
Define and enforce granular access
12:27
policies across your Cloud environment
12:28
keep keeping your AWS environment up to
12:31
date with the latest security patches is
12:33
another ongoing operational task Cloud
12:36
security Engineers work with it and
12:38
development teams to ensure that the
12:40
operating systems applications and
12:42
Library are always updated to address
12:45
known vulnerabilities this helps
12:47
minimize the attack surface and reduces
12:49
the risk of exploitation okay perfect so
12:52
we've covered fre key errors but let's
12:54
understand more about the projects that
12:56
cloud security engineers get their hands
12:58
dirty with Cloud security Engineers work
13:00
on projects to design secure
13:02
architectures for new applications and
13:05
services this involves collaboration
13:07
with development teams to ensure the
13:09
security is built in from the start
13:11
rather than bolted on later by
13:13
incorporating security best practices
13:15
and design principles you can create
13:17
resilient and secure architectures and
13:20
also withstand potential threats most
13:22
people think about security when it's
13:24
too late but it's time we all start
13:26
thinking about security from the start
13:28
now depending on your industry and
13:29
location you will be involved in
13:31
projects to ensure compliance and
13:33
various standards such as Hippa PCI DSS
13:37
or gdpr Cloud security Engineers play a
13:39
key role in assessing compliance
13:41
requirements implementing necessary
13:43
controls and maintaining audit Trails
13:46
this involves working closely with
13:48
compliance teams and Auditors to
13:50
demonstrate that you're adhering to
13:52
relevant standards to be honest I think
13:55
compliance and Regulatory standards is
13:57
very boring but don't tell anyone that
13:59
anyway Cloud security Engineers also
14:01
work on projects to automate security
14:03
tasks and optimize security processes
14:06
this can involve developing scripts and
14:08
tools to automate security assessments
14:10
implementing security orchestration and
14:12
response platforms or integrating
14:14
security tools with AWS Services Now by
14:17
automating repetitive task and
14:19
streamlining processes you can improve
14:22
the efficiency and reduce the risk of
14:24
human error and by focusing on these key
14:27
tasks Technologies Opera
14:29
and projects Cloud security Engineers
14:32
can effectively secure and protect Cloud
14:34
environments leveraging the power of AWS
14:37
native services along with third-party
14:39
tools like sneak enables you to take a
14:41
comprehensive and proactive approach to
14:44
Cloud security okay so what skills and
14:47
certifications do you need to learn and
14:49
become a cloud security engineer and for
14:51
this role having a right mix of
14:53
Technical and soft skills is crucial so
14:56
let's break down some of these key areas
14:58
that you should focus on first and
14:59
foremost you need a solid understanding
15:02
of General it in Cloud engineering
15:04
fundamentals before going into Cloud
15:07
platforms like AWS Azure or Google cloud
15:10
and their respective Security Services
15:12
each platform has its own unique set of
15:14
tools and best practices for securing
15:16
Cloud environments so you need to be
15:18
familiar with those areas next you want
15:20
to dive into Network and application
15:22
security Concepts this includes things
15:24
like understanding common
15:26
vulnerabilities implementing secure
15:27
network architecture and protecting
15:29
against web application attacks a strong
15:32
foundation in these areas will serve you
15:35
well as you design and Implement
15:37
security controls in the cloud identity
15:39
and access management or IM am is
15:41
another key skill area in the cloud IM
15:44
am is all about ensuring the right users
15:46
have the right level of access to the
15:48
right resources you need to master
15:50
Concepts like user and role management
15:53
authentication and authorization along
15:55
with multiactor authentication as a
15:57
cloud security engineer you need to be
15:59
well-versed in security Frameworks and
16:02
compliance standards such as ISO and
16:04
gdpr to provide guidelines and best
16:07
practices for securing systems and
16:09
protecting data understanding these
16:11
Frameworks will help you design and
16:13
Implement security controls that meet
16:15
industry standards and regulatory
16:17
requirements I know it's a lot and it's
16:19
not easy but you can do it scripting and
16:21
automation skills are also incredibly
16:23
valuable being able to write scripts in
16:26
a language like python or bash can help
16:28
you autom make repetitive security task
16:30
like provisioning resources or analyzing
16:32
log files this not only saves time but
16:36
also reduces the risk of human error
16:38
incident response and forensic skills
16:40
are crucial for dealing with security
16:42
breaches when they happen you need to
16:44
know how to quickly contain and mitigate
16:46
incidents as well as how to conduct far
16:49
investigations to determine the root
16:51
cause and prevent any future occurrences
16:55
risk assessment and management is
16:56
another key area as a cloud security
16:59
engineer you'll be responsible for
17:01
identifying and assessing potential
17:03
security risks and then developing
17:05
strategies to mitigate those risks this
17:07
requires an understanding of the threet
17:09
landscape as well as the ability to
17:11
prioritize and address the risk based on
17:14
the potential impact and finally don't
17:17
underestimate the importance of soft
17:19
skills like communication and
17:21
collaboration as a cloud security
17:23
engineer you'll be working closely with
17:25
teams across the business from
17:27
developers to operations to Executives
17:30
being able to clearly communicate
17:32
complex security Concepts and
17:33
collaborate effectively with others is
17:35
essential for success in this role all
17:38
right now let's talk about
17:39
certifications while hands-on experience
17:41
is obviously very important and valuable
17:43
certifications can validate your skills
17:45
and give you a bit of credibility and
17:48
make you more marketable to potential
17:50
employers one great starting point is
17:52
the CompTIA Security Plus certification
17:55
this vendor neutral certification covers
17:57
a wide range of cyber security topics
17:59
from network security to compliance to
18:01
operational security it's a great way to
18:03
demonstrate a solid foundation in
18:05
security principles for those looking to
18:08
specialize in Cloud security which is of
18:10
course all of you guys AWS security
18:12
speciality is a popular choice this
18:15
certification demonstrates Advanced
18:17
knowledge of securing AWS environments
18:20
including data protection infrastructure
18:22
security instant response and of course
18:25
security automation another highly
18:27
regarded certification is the certified
18:30
Cloud security professional or the ccsp
18:32
this certification validates Knowledge
18:34
and Skills in Cloud security
18:36
architecture design operations and
18:38
service orchestration finally the
18:41
certified information system security
18:43
professional also known as cisp is often
18:45
considered the golden standard in cyber
18:48
security certifications while it's not
18:50
Cloud specific cisp covers a broad range
18:53
of security topics and he highly valued
18:55
by employers across Industries across
18:58
countries across companies now to excel
19:00
as a cloud security engineer focus on
19:02
building a strong foundation in Cloud
19:04
platforms networking and application
19:06
security of course identity access
19:08
management security framework scripting
19:10
automation instant response risk
19:12
management and soft skills I know it's a
19:15
lot guys it is a lot but nothing comes
19:17
easy and of course you don't need to
19:18
learn all of these at once take your
19:20
time take it slow and remember it's a
19:23
marathon and not a Sprint so far we've
19:25
covered everything but the important
19:27
parts salary and job outlook now when it
19:30
comes to earning potential Cloud
19:31
security Engineers are among the highest
19:34
paid Professionals in the IT industry
19:36
with an average salary of over
19:39
$145,000 per year in the United States
19:42
according to the recent Market data it's
19:44
clear that businesses are willing to
19:46
invest heavily in talent that can help
19:48
them secure their Cloud environments but
19:50
this figure is just an average in
19:52
reality Cloud security Engineers can
19:55
earn a lot more depending on location
19:57
industry exper experience level and of
19:59
course company size now in major Tech
20:02
hubs like San Francisco New York and
20:04
Seattle for example it's not uncommon
20:06
for senior level cloud security
20:08
Engineers to have salaries of upwards of
20:11
$200,000 per year and don't get me
20:13
started on contractors and Freelancers
20:16
and these figures are only expected to
20:18
rise in the coming years as more and
20:20
more businesses migrate their operations
20:22
to the cloud the demand for skilled
20:24
Cloud Security Professionals is only
20:26
getting higher in fact according to a
20:29
recent report from the research dive the
20:31
global Cloud security Market is expected
20:34
to grow at a compound annual growth rate
20:37
of over 17.5% from 2001 to
20:41
2028 reaching a total Market size of
20:45
over $75 billion now this explosive
20:48
growth is driven by a number of
20:50
different factors the adoption of cloud
20:52
computing the increasing complexity of
20:54
cyber threats and the growing importance
20:57
of data privacy and compliance are all
21:00
contributing to the need of robust Cloud
21:02
security measures and as a result of
21:04
this businesses across Industries are
21:06
scrambling to hire Cloud security
21:09
Engineers who can help them navigate
21:10
this complex landscape the job outlook
21:13
for cloud security Engineers is also
21:15
equally promising according to the US
21:17
Bureau of Labor Statistics and
21:19
employment of information security
21:21
analyst which of course includes Cloud
21:24
security Engineers is projected to grow
21:26
by 31% from 20 19 2029 which is much
21:31
faster than the average for all
21:33
occupations to put this into perspective
21:35
the average growth rate for all
21:36
occupations is just 4% this means that
21:39
over the next decade we can expect to
21:41
see the creation of over 40,000 new jobs
21:43
in the information security field in the
21:46
us alone and with the growing prominence
21:48
of cloud computing it's safe to say that
21:50
a significant portion of these jobs will
21:53
be focused on cloud security but it's
21:55
not just the number of jobs that make
21:57
this field so attractive Ive it's also
21:59
the nature of the work itself as a cloud
22:02
security engineer you'll have the
22:04
opportunity to work at a key part of
22:06
Technology tackling complex challenges
22:09
and playing a key role in protecting an
22:11
organization from cyber threats you'll
22:13
be part of a fastpaced and constantly
22:16
evolving industry where no two days are
22:19
the same the skills you develop as a
22:20
cloud security engineer are also highly
22:22
transferable across Industries whether
22:24
you're working for a financial
22:26
institution a healthc care provider a
22:28
government agency or a tech startup the
22:30
fundamental principles of cloud security
22:33
remain the same across these industries
22:35
this means that once you build a strong
22:37
foundation in Cloud security you'll have
22:39
a wide range of career options to choose
22:41
from and of course with such high demand
22:44
and attractive salaries the competition
22:46
for cloud security engineer roles can
22:48
also be high to stand out in this market
22:50
it's important to continuously invest in
22:52
your skills and your knowledge staying
22:54
up to date with the latest Cloud
22:56
security tools best practices and of
22:57
course fret landscape will be key to
23:00
your success in this area and there you
23:02
have it a complete guide and breakdown
23:04
on what a cloud security engineer
23:07

====================================================
How I would learn Cloud Security (If I could start over)

In this video, I reveal my proven 3-step blueprint to Learn Cloud Security and ACTUALLY get a Job.

I'll share the Cloud Security foundations you must learn, what projects you need, and, the new way to get hired that nobody's talking about.


0:00
if you clicked on this video chances are
0:01
that you want to land a job in Cloud
0:03
security and with good reason the cloud
0:05
computing Market is exploding projected
0:08
to reach an insane 1.6 trillion by 2030
0:11
now combined with the fact that 35% of
0:14
organizations say cloud security is
0:17
their biggest talent Gap and nearly 40%
0:19
of it professionals report it as their
0:21
most critical skills shortage so what is
0:25
that creating an unprecedented
0:27
opportunity you see companies are
0:30
scrambling to hire and they're willing
0:31
to pay top dollar to secure top talent
0:34
Cloud security Engineers are commanding
0:36
on average
0:37
$133,000 with total compensation
0:40
packages reaching over
0:42
$160,000 but there's a catch as always
0:46
so if you're new here hi I'm slan I've
0:49
worked in tech for a decade and today I
0:51
help businesses scale and secure the
0:53
cloud infrastructure on AWS now also
0:56
running my education company I've
0:58
discovered that most people are approach
1:00
in this golden opportunity in Cloud
1:02
security completely wrong they pass a
1:04
few certifications and watch a few
1:06
YouTube tutorials and then they wonder
1:08
why they're not able to get a job if
1:11
that's you right now then don't worry
1:13
it's not your fault the rules of the
1:15
game for 2025 have completely changed
1:18
and nobody told you the new rules so I'm
1:22
going to give away my fre step blueprint
1:24
for the fastest way to learn Cloud
1:26
security and actually land a job and no
1:29
I'm not teaching teaching you anything
1:30
that doesn't work this is the same route
1:33
that students inside of my Academy are
1:35
leveraging to land jobs like mac and J
1:38
but we'll get to that later on and by
1:39
the way join over 10,000 engineers and
1:42
grab our beginner's guide to the cloud
1:43
it's completely free Linked In the
Foundation
1:45
description so the first step to Landing
1:47
your Cloud security jobs is actually
1:49
building a solid foundation in the cloud
1:51
you have to understand how it works like
1:53
before you can go out and about and
1:55
secure things you need to know what you
1:57
are actually securing I know it s sounds
2:00
obvious but you'd be surprised how many
2:02
people ski this important step so you
2:04
got to understand what cloud computing
2:06
is why we use a cloud and delve in deep
2:09
and I also want you to focus on AWS not
2:12
only is it the market leader so it has
2:14
the most opportunities but everything
2:16
that you learn in AWS is also applicable
2:18
to Azure and gcp and because I'm an
2:21
expert so you know I'm never going to
2:23
recommend you something that I'm not
2:24
already an expert in so some of the
2:26
things that you will cover is what the
2:28
shared responsibility model is right how
2:31
do Cloud providers manage the physical
2:33
security and some of the infrastructure
2:35
but you as the user will be responsible
2:37
for the data the permissions and the
2:38
applications that you deploy this step
2:40
is just about getting comfortable with
2:42
new Concepts and you're not going to
2:43
become an expert after a single week but
2:46
you're going to be picking things up
2:48
really quickly and honestly if you are a
Virtualization
2:51
beginner you should get your AWS Cloud
2:53
practitioner certification as well that
2:55
won't really take you more than just 2
2:56
weeks and it's a good way to build your
2:58
confidence so you also come across
3:00
virtualization this is fundamental to
3:03
how the cloud works because it allows
3:05
you to split one physical computer into
3:07
multiple separate virtual machines and
3:09
why is that good now each virtual
3:11
computer has its own operating system
3:13
memory and it runs independently which
3:16
means that if things go wrong or one of
3:18
the machines crashes the whole system
3:20
doesn't fail just the individual machine
3:22
so for example if one of them virtual
3:24
machines gets infected with malware
3:26
because you haven't secured it properly
3:27
it can't spread to others and this this
3:29
is how Cloud providers like AWS run all
3:32
these customer workflows on the same
3:33
physical Hardware whilst keeping
3:35
everyone's data separate and secure it's
3:37
through virtualization now I've covered
3:40
virtualization but there's also storage
3:42
networking understanding what operating
3:44
systems are and just basic Cloud
3:46
architecture then it's time to layer in
3:49
the cloud security principles on top and
Cloud Security Principles
3:51
you will start with the CIA Triad and
3:53
learn what we mean by confidentiality
3:56
integrity and availability you need to
3:58
learn IM am identity access management
4:00
which is actually a huge section of
4:02
cloud security just by itself I actually
4:05
have a friend that works in this field
4:07
and is definitely a lucrative field to
4:09
be in with plenty of money now you also
4:11
need to cover encryption fundamentals
4:13
threet detection Basics and how we
4:16
Implement these Concepts into Cloud
4:18
environments vpcs are also crucial
4:20
virtual private cloud like find out what
4:23
that even means as well as security
4:25
groups and knackles these are all Cloud
4:27
security fundamentals that complement a
4:29
a lot of the cloud knowledge that you
4:31
would have already built and just to
4:32
make sure you're not cutting any corners
4:34
or missing any gaps you should also get
First Principle Thinking
4:36
your comp Tia Security Plus certificate
4:39
again it's just good for your confidence
4:40
boost and gives you a little bit more
4:42
structured learning that said these
4:44
certificates won't get you a job but
4:46
make sure you wait until step number
4:48
three in this blueprint because I'll be
4:50
giving away the new way to actually land
4:52
a cloud security job in 2025 so to
4:55
really get the most out of step one and
4:57
this is something that I go by myself
4:59
when whenever I'm tackling something new
5:01
you need to have an inquisitorial
5:02
mindset question everything take Elon
5:05
Musk and how he's always drumming on
5:07
about his first principal thinking and
5:09
how he leveraged that to build Tesla and
5:11
SpaceX and all these other great
5:13
companies that he's leading and if you
5:14
don't know first principles thinking is
5:17
basically breaking everything down to
5:18
the most fundamental truths so instead
5:20
of just accepting that oh yeah we need a
5:23
VPC because everyone says so ask
5:25
yourself why do we need it what problem
5:27
is it actually solving how does it make
5:29
our infrastructure more secure like when
5:31
you're learning about security groups
5:33
don't just memorize the details
5:35
understand what that actually means in
5:37
practice what happens when you allow
5:39
inbound traffic what about the return
5:41
traffic why would you choose a security
5:43
group over a knle what are the
5:45
differences do you see what I mean it's
5:47
about digging deeper than just the
5:48
service level stuff that you find in
5:50
certification courses because here is
5:52
the thing in the real world when you're
5:54
working as a cloud security engineer
5:57
you're going to face problems that
5:58
aren't in any study guide and that's
6:01
when this kind of thinking will really
6:03
pay off and that's why I always tell my
6:05
students don't just learn what to do
6:07
learn why we do it when you understand
6:10
the why you can make better decisions
6:12
about security you can look at a
6:13
company's infrastructure and actually
6:15
understand the security needs so as
6:18
you're going through step one keep
6:19
asking questions and once you get that
6:21
breadth of knowledge you're ready for
Build Projects
6:23
step two and that's to apply your
6:25
knowledge and start building projects
6:27
now this actually by far the most
6:28
important step make sure you stay for
6:30
what I'm going to tell you in Step
6:31
number three because when you combine it
6:33
with projects that's the fastest way to
6:36
actually get hired as a cloud security
6:38
engineer and that's the reason why I
6:40
made this video so a lot of beginners
6:42
get caught up in just collecting
6:44
certifications and you're not going to
6:46
make the same mistake because if you
6:47
want to actually land a cloud security
6:49
job you have to get building real world
6:52
solutions that actually solve problems
6:55
and if you're just starting out you can
6:56
start by securing a static website on S3
6:59
which will teach you about bucket
7:00
policies encryption and access control
7:03
the foundation you'll be using is Amazon
7:04
s3e for hosting but we are focusing on
7:07
implementing proper security rather than
7:09
just getting our files online you'll
7:11
learn how to configure bucket policies
7:13
that maintain public access to website
7:15
content while preventing unauthorized
7:17
modifications now the IM am
7:19
configuration the identity and access
7:20
management is where you implement proper
7:23
Access Control you'll create your roles
7:24
with minimum required permissions this
7:26
prevents potential security breaches
7:28
from overly permissive settings and when
7:30
you build this you're learning real
7:32
security architecture that companies are
7:34
actually using and yes this will require
7:36
coding specifically infrastructures code
7:39
with pyone or typescript or terapon
7:41
which adds efficiency and you'll write
7:43
scripts that will handle deployment was
7:45
also verifying security configurations
7:47
this prevents common security gaps that
7:50
happen with manual deployments and these
7:52
scripts can check bucket policies file
7:54
permissions and encryption settings
7:56
before allowing uploads you also
7:58
integrate guard Duty which provides
8:00
active security monitoring you'll set up
8:02
alerts for suspicious activities and
8:03
learn how to respond to potential
8:05
threats and to tie everything together
8:07
you'll want to use GitHub perversion
8:09
control and documentation now this gives
8:11
you a complete history of infrastructure
8:13
changes and provides rollback
8:14
capabilities if security issues are
8:17
discovered that said I can also give you
8:18
loads of project ideas but I've already
8:20
done this in previous videos
8:21
step-by-step breakdowns so I'm not going
8:23
to cover that anymore but that's a great
8:25
one to get started on but if you're
8:26
watching this and thinking okay I'm
8:28
super motivated and want to start
8:30
learning and building projects then I
8:31
want to tell you that I am running a
8:33
special cohort right now and we're
8:35
taking in new students so if you're
8:37
interested and ready to take action just
8:39
like Jay Martinez one of our students
8:41
that got laid off as a banker and got
8:43
hired as a cloud engineer in just a few
8:45
months or Mac who after joining my
8:47
Academy landed a job as a systems
8:48
engineer at AWS then click the link in
8:51
the description and book a call with my
8:52
team but just no this isn't for everyone
8:54
because it's just not possible for us to
8:56
bring in a 100 people at once because
8:58
the demand is really high and right now
9:00
the cloud is booming so we want to make
9:02
sure we can actually help the people
9:04
that we bring on so yeah book a call to
9:06
see if you qualify for our special
My Secret
9:08
cohort now that brings me to step number
9:10
three which is one key strategy that
9:12
will actually get you a job but we can
9:14
only get to the solution once we've
9:15
covered the current state of the job
9:17
market so throughout the years of
9:19
working multiple sixf figure roles I
9:21
never really had to apply for them and
9:22
I'm going to share you my secret right
9:24
now so everyone's out there thinking oh
9:26
I'll just apply for hundreds of jobs
9:28
send my TV write a nice cover letter but
9:31
let me tell you what's actually
9:32
happening behind the scenes and why you
9:34
might be struggling I'm seeing
9:36
businesses especially smaller ones right
9:38
now getting absolutely flooded with
9:40
applications I listed a job application
9:42
not long ago and I got hundreds of
9:43
applications in fact I get daily
9:45
messages of people wanting to work for
9:48
me for free despite having many years of
9:50
experience people aren't able to find a
9:53
job and the thing is with how chat GPT
9:55
and AI tools are making it very easy to
9:57
apply for jobs and what is that called
9:59
these businesses are just getting
10:01
overwhelmed with applications they're
10:03
getting all of these applications that
10:05
look amazing on paper but there's no
10:07
trust there there's no real connection
10:10
and that's where I want you to pay
10:11
attention because this is the key thing
10:14
that most people are missing in today's
10:16
market 2025 is not about just having the
10:18
technical skills anymore yes you need
10:21
them don't get me wrong that's your
10:22
foundation but what's actually going to
Trust
10:24
land you that job it is trust it's
10:27
building real connections in a community
10:30
and think about it from a business
10:32
owner's perspective if I'm running a
10:34
small team and I need to hire someone am
10:36
I going to read and look through all of
10:38
these thousands of AI generated
10:41
applications absolutely not I am going
10:44
to look at my network I'm looking at the
10:46
people who've been consistently showing
10:48
up the ones who've been adding value in
10:50
my community the people who are landing
10:52
jobs aren just Mass applying for them
10:54
they're the ones who are in there every
10:55
day helping others solve problems
10:57
sharing their knowledge they are
10:59
building trust before they even need to
11:01
ask for a job now I know what some of
11:03
you might be thinking but I don't have
11:06
time for all that I need a job right now
11:09
and listen I get it I understand but in
11:12
today's job market you've got to play
11:14
the long game you've got to be genuine
11:17
about it if you're not actually
11:18
passionate about Cloud security if
11:20
you're not willing to put in the
11:22
groundwork to build those relationships
11:24
to provide the value is going to be
11:27
really tough for you and look here is
11:29
something that I've learned from running
11:30
my own businesses we have to get every
11:33
hiring decision right I need to
11:35
genuinely believe that it's the right
11:36
decision because the implications for me
11:39
are big so ask yourself am I going to
11:41
trust a random application or someone in
11:44
my community that's been providing value
11:46
exactly and this isn't just me do you
11:49
know why Amazon and JP Morgan and all
11:51
these big tech companies always ask for
11:54
referrals or if you've been referred by
11:56
someone it's because of trust they
11:58
FastTrack these candidates straight to
12:00
interviews because someone they trust is
12:02
vouching for them now I'm not going to
12:04
lie to you yes applying for hundreds of
12:06
job applications will get you somewhere
12:08
and it's a numbers game and if you keep
12:10
at it something will stick and that's
12:12
worked for me in the past but let's be
12:14
real most people get demoralized and
12:17
will give up after just 10 applications
12:19
and here is the reality 90% of
12:21
recruiters are on LinkedIn actively
12:24
searching for candidates they are
12:25
literally there looking for people like
12:27
yourself and this is what I'm seeing for
12:29
my own students right and when they
12:30
start implementing their LinkedIn
12:32
strategies they start getting inbound
12:33
from recruiters and think about it if a
12:35
recruiter searches for cloud security
12:37
engineer and you're not showing up in
12:39
those searches then you don't exist to
12:41
them you are invisible but when you're
12:43
actively posting now you are on their
12:46
radar and that's what's happening with
12:48
all of our students they're not just
12:50
sitting there sending out applications
12:52
into the void because when recruiters
12:54
come to you you are already positioned
12:56
as someone valuable because they want to
12:59
to you and The Leverage that that gives
13:01
you it's night and day and a secret tip
13:03
for you right now especially on LinkedIn
13:06
videos are the way to go just look at my
13:08
LinkedIn if you haven't seen already I'm
13:10
doubling down on this myself on my own
13:12
LinkedIn and posting videos every single
13:14
day and I'm getting so many more
13:16
Impressions and therefore leads for my
13:19
businesses and if you want the
13:20
step-by-step road map for everything
13:22
that you need to learn in Cloud security

What is Cloud Security? Explained in 15 minutes

Cloud Security, what is it? Why is it important, and why are cloud security jobs the most in demand roles in tech right now.



0:00
Cloud security what is it why is it
0:03
important and why are Cloud security
0:05
jobs the most in demand roles in Tech
0:08
right now I've got my own cloud security
0:11
business and we help startups and
0:12
businesses around the world secure their
0:15
Cloud environments now if you're not
0:17
paying attention to Cloud security then
0:19
you are going to get left behind and I'm
0:22
here to make sure that that doesn't
0:24
happen to you the world is moving to the
0:27
cloud at an insane pace it's like a gold
0:31
rush and everyone wants a piece of the
0:33
action in fact by 2028 if businesses are
0:38
not using Cloud technology it's very
0:40
likely that they will no longer exist
0:43
but here is the thing with great power
0:45
comes great responsibility and when it
0:47
comes to the cloud that responsibility
0:50
is all about keeping your data and
0:52
applications safe from the bad guys you
0:55
might be thinking but San I'm just a
0:58
beginner do I really need to worry about
1:01
Cloud security Now the answer is a
1:04
resounding yes it doesn't matter if
1:06
you're a solar developer or a big
1:09
Enterprise if you're using the cloud you
1:12
need to prioritize security the reality
1:14
is that the cloud is a whole different
1:17
world compared to traditional it
1:19
environments you've got data flying
1:22
around everywhere people accessing
1:24
resources from all over the world and a
1:27
ton of moving parts to keep track track
1:30
of it's like trying to secure a massive
1:33
complex puzzle with pieces that are
1:36
constantly changing but don't let that
1:38
scare you off the key is to educate
1:40
yourself and stay vigilant you need to
1:43
understand the common threats the best
1:45
practices and the tools at your disposal
1:48
to keep your Cloud environment locked
1:51
down tight and that's exactly what we're
1:53
going to cover in this video I'm going
1:55
to break down Cloud Security in a way
1:58
that even a complete new gr can
2:00
understand we'll talk about the shared
2:02
responsibility model the different
2:04
layers of security best practices and
2:07
practical steps that you can take to
2:09
secure your Cloud setup before we get
2:11
started you should check out my weekly
2:13
Cloud newsletter where I share free
2:15
resources tutorials boot camps and so
2:18
much more helping you get started with
2:20
the cloud when you're are working in the
2:22
cloud you are part of a larger ecosystem
2:25
a single week link can have effects that
2:27
impact everyone that's why it's crucial
2:30
for every cloud professional to
2:32
prioritize security and work together to
2:35
create a safer Cloud environment for
2:37
everyone remember the cloud is the
2:39
future and security is a non-negotiable
2:41
you can either learn to secure it now or
2:44
get left in the dust the choice is yours
2:47
before you learn about Cloud security
2:49
you need to understand what cloud
2:51
engineering and cloud computing is so
2:54
let's go over it cloud computing is the
2:56
delivery of Computing Services over the
2:58
Internet with we're talking about things
3:00
like servers storage databases software
3:04
and more instead of having all of this
3:06
stuff on your own computer or in your
3:08
own data center is all hosted remotely
3:12
and access through the web now cloud
3:14
computing has some key characteristics
3:17
that make it a complete GameChanger the
Key Characteristics
3:19
cloud is on demand self-service where
3:22
you can spin up Cloud resources whenever
3:25
you need them without having to go
3:27
through a bunch of red tape it's like
3:30
having a vending machine for computing
3:32
power Cloud gives you a broad network
3:34
access that you can access your Cloud
3:37
resources from anywhere with just an
3:39
internet connection whether you're on
3:41
your phone a tablet or a computer the
3:43
cloud is always within your reach and
3:46
finally rapid elasticity with the cloud
3:49
this means you can scale up or down
3:52
instantly based on your needs if you
3:54
suddenly get a surge of traffic the
3:56
cloud can handle it without breaking a
3:59
sweat now when it comes to cloud service
4:01
models there are three main parts
4:04
infrastructure as a service this is when
4:06
you rent the basic building blocks of
4:09
computing like virtual machines and
4:11
storage you have a lot of control but
4:13
you also have to manage a lot of the
4:15
underlying infrastructure then we also
Cloud Deployment Models
4:18
have platform as a service with platform
4:20
as a service you get preconfigured
4:22
environments for developing testing and
4:25
deploying your applications you don't
4:27
have to worry about the underlying
4:29
infrastructure you can focus on writing
4:31
code for your applications and then we
4:34
have software as a service this is where
4:36
you use software that's hosted and
4:38
managed by the cloud provider think of
4:41
things like email office suites and
4:43
customer relationship management tools
4:46
also known as CRM finally let's talk
4:48
about Cloud deployment models we have
4:51
public Cloud private Cloud hybrid cloud
4:54
and also multic Cloud public cloud is
4:56
where you use a cloud providers
4:58
infrastructure and your resources are
5:00
shared with other customers it's like
5:03
living in an apartment complex private
5:05
cloud is where you have dedicated
5:08
resources that are only used by your
5:10
business or your organization this is
5:12
like having your own house hybrid cloud
5:15
has a mix of public and private clouds
5:18
where you can move your workloads
5:20
between them as needed it's like having
5:22
a vacation home in addition to your
5:24
primary residence in your usual location
Cloud Security
5:27
and finally multicloud this this is
5:29
where you use multiple Cloud providers
5:31
for different services this is like
5:33
having a diverse Investment Portfolio so
5:37
there you have it the basics of cloud
5:39
computing it's definitely complex but
5:41
understanding these fundamentals is
5:43
crucial if you want to succeed in the
5:45
cloud and Cloud security so what is
5:47
cloud security Now picture this you've
5:49
got your data your applications and your
5:51
infrastructure all running smoothly in
5:53
the cloud life is good right but then
5:56
disaster strikes a hacker finds a way to
5:59
steal your data and takes down your
6:01
services suddenly your business is in
6:04
shambles and you've left wondering what
6:07
went wrong that's where Cloud security
6:10
comes in it's the armor that protects
6:13
your assets in the cloud keeping the bad
6:16
guys out and ensuring that your business
6:18
can Thrive without any Interruption at
6:21
its core Cloud security is all about
6:23
safeguarding your data your applications
6:26
and your infrastructure from
6:27
unauthorized access and damage it's
6:30
about maintaining the confidentiality
6:33
integrity and availability of your
6:35
resources in the face of the constant
6:38
evolving threats but here is the thing
6:40
Cloud security isn't just the
6:42
responsibility of your cloud provider
6:45
it's a shared responsibility model which
6:47
means that both you and your provider
6:50
like AWS have a role to play your cloud
6:53
provider is responsible for securing the
6:55
underlying infrastructure like the
6:57
physical data centers the network and
6:59
the virtualization layer they make sure
7:02
that the foundation is solid and that
7:04
the basic security measures are in place
7:07
but you as the customer are responsible
7:10
for securing everything you put on top
7:13
of that infrastructure this includes
7:15
your operating system your applications
7:18
and your data you need to make sure that
7:20
you are configuring your resources
7:22
properly managing access controls and
7:24
staying on top of patches and updates so
7:27
what are the key aspects of cloud
7:29
security that you need to focus on let's
7:32
break it down firstly we have data
Key Aspects of Cloud Security
7:34
protection this is about keeping your
7:36
data safe for many prying eyes and
7:39
ensuring that your data is always
7:42
available when you need it encryption
7:44
backup and Disaster Recovery are all
7:47
crucial components of data protection
7:50
next we have access control and identity
7:52
management you need to be able to
7:54
control who has access to your resources
7:57
and what they can do with them this
7:59
means implementing strong authentication
8:02
authorization and identity management
8:04
practices let's talk about network
8:05
security because your Cloud resources
8:07
are only as secure as the network that
8:10
they're running on you need to make sure
8:12
that your network is properly segmented
8:14
the traffic is filtered and monitored
8:16
and that you have defenses in place
8:18
against common attacks like dos we can't
8:21
talk about Cloud protection and Cloud
8:23
security without compliance and
8:25
regulatory requirements depending on
8:27
your industry and location you may be
8:30
subject to various regulations and
8:32
standards such as Hippa PCI DSS or gdpr
8:36
you need to ensure that your Cloud
8:38
environment is compliant with these
8:39
requirements and that you have the
8:41
necessary controls in place now no
8:44
matter how strong your defenses are
8:46
there's always a chance that something
8:48
could go wrong that's why you need to
8:49
have a plan in place for detecting
8:52
responding to and recovering from
8:54
security incidents and disasters now I
8:57
know this all sounds like a lot to take
9:00
in but do not worry because you don't
9:02
have to go at it alone there are plenty
9:05
of tools best practices and partners out
9:08
there that can help and secure your
9:10
Cloud environment including my company
9:12
Soul security the key is to prioritize
9:15
security from the start and to make it
9:17
an integral part of your Cloud strategy
9:19
and that's why at my company Soul
9:21
security we help businesses secure their
9:23
Cloud environments and keep their
9:25
applications data and customers safe all
9:28
right so now that we know what cloud
9:29
computing Cloud security and some of the
9:31
key aspects are but what are some of the
Cloud Security Threats
9:33
cloud security threats and challenges
9:37
that we and businesses all need to be
9:40
aware of first up we've got data
9:42
breaches and unauthorized access this is
9:45
the stuff of nightmares imagine waking
9:48
up one morning to find out that your
9:50
sensitive data has been stolen and
9:53
splashed all over the dark web it's not
9:55
a pretty picture but it's the reality
9:57
that far too many organiz ations have
10:00
had to face next we've got insecure apis
10:03
and interfaces these are like the back
10:05
doors into your Cloud environment if
10:08
they're not properly secured hackers can
10:10
walk right in and create absolute Havoc
10:13
think of it as leaving your front door
10:15
wide open and then being surprised when
10:17
someone comes in and robs your house but
10:20
here is the thing sometimes the biggest
10:22
threat to your Cloud security isn't some
10:25
random hacker on the Internet it's
10:27
actually the people within your
10:29
organization misconfiguration and human
10:31
error are responsible for a staggering
10:33
number of security breaches one wrong
10:36
click one misconfigured setting and
10:38
suddenly your data is out there for the
10:41
world to see in fact I followed this
10:43
Twitter page and they always share data
10:45
breaches that are happening live around
10:47
the world and you'll be surprised how
10:49
many breaches are happening every single
Insider Threats
10:52
day and let's not forget about Insider
10:54
frats these are the people who have
10:57
legitimate access to your systems but
10:59
use that access for really bad purposes
11:02
it could be a disgruntled employee
11:04
looking to cause damage or even a
11:07
malicious actor who's managed to
11:09
infiltrate your ranks either way inside
11:12
a threet can be incredibly difficult to
11:14
detect and to prevent but wait there's
11:18
actually more denial of service also
11:20
known as dos attacks these are like the
11:22
schoolyard bullies of the cloud World
11:25
they flood your systems with so much
11:27
traffic that you grind to a halt leaving
11:30
your legitimate users out in the cold is
11:33
a frustrating and costly problem that
11:36
can be tough to defend against and if
11:38
you really want to lose sleep at night
11:40
let me introduce to you to advanced
11:42
persistent threats also known as APS
11:44
these are the Elite hackers the ones who
11:47
are in it for the long haul they quietly
11:49
infiltrate your systems establish a
11:51
foothold and then slowly pull your data
11:54
over time and by the time that you
11:56
realize what's happening it's often too
11:58
late now with the right tools strategies
12:01
and mindset you can fight back and keep
12:03
your Cloud environment safe and secure
12:05
it's not going to be easy and it's not
12:07
going to be a one-time thing Cloud
12:08
security is an ongoing battle a
12:10
NeverEnding game of cat and mouse
12:13
between the good guys and the bad guys
12:15
but with vigilance determination and a
12:17
healthy dose of paranoia you can stay
12:20
one step ahead of the threats and keep
12:22
your data and applications out of Harm's
12:25
Way all right so you've heard about all
12:26
the nasty threats and challenges that
12:28
come within the cloud it's enough to
12:30
make you want to unplug your router and
12:32
then just go live in a cave but before
12:34
you do that let me give you some good
12:36
news there are plenty of best practices
Best Practices
12:38
and solutions that can help keep your
12:40
Cloud environment locked down and I'm
12:42
going to share some of those best
12:43
practices with you so first and foremost
12:46
you need to implement strong access
12:47
controls and identity management this is
12:50
like having a bouncer at an exclusive
12:52
nightclub if you're not on the list you
12:54
are not getting in make sure you're
12:56
using MFA to add an extra layer of
12:58
security
12:59
Beyond just passwords you also want to
13:02
implement role based Access Control to
13:04
ensure that users only have access to
13:06
the resources that they need to do their
13:08
jobs always follow the least privileged
13:11
principle give users the minimum level
13:13
of access required and not a single bit
13:16
more next encryption encryption is your
13:19
best friend encrypting data at rest and
13:22
in transit is like putting your
13:24
sensitive information in a high tech
13:26
safe even if the bad guys get get their
13:29
hands on it they won't be able to read
13:31
it without the key so make sure you are
13:33
using strong encryption methods and
13:35
managing your keys securely now let's
13:37
talk about network security you need to
13:39
make sure that your network is segmented
13:42
and secured you can use vpns to create
13:44
secure Tunnels for remote access you can
13:46
Implement Network segmentation and micro
13:49
segmentation to create smaller and more
13:51
manageable security zones it's like
13:53
putting up walls and checkpoints through
13:55
your network to keep the bad guys out of
13:58
your cloud environment but security
14:00
isn't just about keeping the bad guys
14:03
out it's about keeping a watchful eye on
14:06
what's Happening inside of your Cloud
14:09
environment and this is where monitoring
14:11
and logging come into the picture
14:13
Implement centralized logging and
14:14
monitoring to keep track of all of your
14:17
activity in your Cloud you can also use
Security Tools
14:19
security information and event
14:21
management tools to analyze logs and
14:23
detect potential threats and don't
14:25
forget about intrusion detection and
14:27
prevention systems ID PPS these are like
14:30
your personal security guards constantly
14:32
watching for suspicion activities and
14:34
sounding the alarm when something looks
14:37
a little bit fishy now of course even
14:39
the best security tools are useless if
14:42
they're not kept up to dat that's why
14:44
patch management and vulnerability
14:46
scanning are so crucial make sure you're
14:49
patching your systems and applications
14:51
to close any known security holes always
14:54
do this automatically and conduct
14:56
regular vulnerability scans to identify
14:58
any any weaknesses before the bad guys
15:00
can come in and exploit them but here is
15:03
the thing security isn't just about
15:06
technology it's about people that's why
15:08
you need employee training and awareness
15:11
because that's so important you want to
15:13
make sure your employees know how to
15:15
spot fishing create strong passwords and
15:17
handle sensitive data securely a
15:19
well-informed workplace is your first
15:21
line of defense against any sort of
15:24
hacks so there you have it the best
15:26
practices and solutions to keep your
15:27
Cloud environment secure it's not going
15:29
to be easy and it's going to require
15:31
constant vigilance and effort but with
15:33
the right tools strategies and mindset
15:35
and a right partner AKA Soul security
15:38
you can make sure your Cloud environment
15:39
is secure and there you have it you know
15:41
what cloud computing is cloud security
15:43
is the best practices common threets and
15:46
what to do with the Frets now it's not
15:48
going to be easy you need to constantly
15:49
learn constantly evolve and constantly
15:51
train your employees but if you need any
15:53
help reach out to Soul curity like the
15:56
video subscribe if you haven't already
15:57
and book a call with soul security if
15:59
you're a business requiring any sort of
16:01
cloud security and I'll see you guys on

The Complete Cloud Security Engineer Roadmap (2025)

Having worked in IT for 10 years and now as a Cloud Security Specialist, I know exactly what it takes to work in this industry.

In this video, I'll show you the exact step by step path I'd take if I wanted to become Cloud Security Engineer in 2025. 


0:00
last week I rejected a
0:02
$348,000 cloud security job offer 5
0:05
years ago I couldn't even get companies
0:07
to look at my resume what changed well I
0:10
discovered the secret that companies
0:12
actually want and it's not what you
0:14
think hi I'm San I'm A Cloud engineer
0:16
and I run my own cloud Security
0:18
consultancy today I'm revealing the
0:20
exact road map that you need to become a
0:22
cloud security engineer after a decade
0:24
in it and helping hundreds of students
0:26
succeed I know one thing for certain you
0:29
don't need a degree or years of
0:31
experience to break into Cloud security
0:33
I've broken it down into three simple
0:35
phases that anyone can follow learn
0:38
build own and if you stay until the end
0:40
of this video you'll know exactly how to
0:42
land a cloud security job by the way
0:44
grab my beginner's guide to the cloud
0:46
it's free Link in the description so
0:48
phase one learn but what do you need to
0:51
learn well there is three steps starting
0:54
with step number one building your
0:56
foundational it knowledge Begin by
0:58
understanding TCP and IP the main
1:01
protocol for internet communication like
1:03
the postal service for sending and
1:05
receiving data online next you want to
1:07
learn about DNS domain name system the
1:09
phone book of the internet which
1:11
translates domain names into IP
1:13
addresses that computers use to locate
1:16
each other finally dive into subnetting
1:18
which divides large networks into
1:20
smaller organized segments making it
1:22
easier to manage and secure Cloud
1:24
infrastructure you'll need to cover
1:25
operating systems as well focusing on
1:28
both windows and Linux so start by
1:30
practicing basic commands in Windows
1:32
Powershell and linux's Bash terminal get
1:34
familiar with file manipulation Process
1:36
Management and system monitoring since
1:38
most Cloud servers use Linux you'll need
1:41
to get comfortable with Linux specific
1:43
tasks like package management
1:44
configuring services and basic system
1:46
administration you also need to
1:48
understand cyber security foundations
1:50
start with the CIA Triad confidentiality
1:53
integrity and availability understand
1:56
common threats like malware and social
1:58
engineering to recognize ize how attacks
2:01
happen get comfortable with
2:02
authentication methods access control
2:04
and basic encryption to protect data you
2:07
also need to learn how to use firewalls
2:09
Network protocols and intrusion
2:11
detection tools to keep systems secure
2:13
step two you need to learn free cloud
2:15
computing basic concepts so cloud
2:18
computing relies on virtualization which
2:20
allows a single physical machine to run
2:22
multiple virtual environments now in
2:24
these virtualized environments you'll
2:26
often work with virtual machines and
2:28
containers virtual machines act as
2:30
independent computers each with its own
2:33
operating system while containers are
2:34
more lightweight sharing the operating
2:36
system but including only application
2:39
dependencies now each has unique
2:41
security requirements so understanding
2:43
how to secure VMS virtual machines and
2:45
containers individually is crucial
2:48
secondly cloud services are typically
2:50
offered in free forms infrastructure as
2:52
a service platform as a service and
2:54
software as a service each model offers
2:57
different levels of control with
2:58
infrastructure as a service you manage
3:00
virtual machines networking and storage
3:03
platform as a service manages the
3:05
infrastructure allowing you to focus on
3:07
development and deployment in software
3:09
as a service everything is handled by
3:11
the provider leaving you to focus only
3:14
on the application Level security it's
3:16
also valuable to explore the main Cloud
3:18
providers AWS Azure and Google Cloud as
3:21
each excels in different areas but we
3:24
stick with AWS because it has the
3:26
largest market share finally
3:28
responsibilities are shared between you
3:30
and the cloud provider like AWS while
3:33
the provider handles the physical
3:35
security and the infrastructure aspects
3:37
you are responsible for securing your
3:39
data managing access and setting
3:41
permissions step three because you want
3:43
to work as a cloud security engineer you
3:45
have to understand Cloud security
3:47
fundamentals identity and access
3:49
management controls who can access which
3:52
resources so learning identity and
3:53
access management or IM am means knowing
3:56
user roles permissions groups and access
3:58
controls all of which help you keep your
4:00
Cloud environment safe and secure data
4:03
security is a priority and encryption
4:05
plays a big role so get familiar with
4:07
the types of encryption data at rest
4:10
data in transit and client side
4:12
encryption and finally network security
4:15
learn to configure virtual private
4:16
clouds vpcs security groups and access
4:19
control lists ACLS both host based and
4:22
network-based firewalls are important
4:24
for managing access Now by setting up
4:26
these controls you can reduce the risk
4:29
of unal access and other security issues
4:32
now as a bonus option in a learn phase
4:34
you also need to get certified beginners
4:36
make the mistake in thinking that these
4:38
are the golden ticket that cloud
4:39
security jobs now for normal Cloud roles
4:41
I would say that these do not matter but
4:43
for specialized roles like Cloud
4:45
security they are definitely important
4:47
they are there for you to consolidate
4:49
your learning and give yourself some
4:50
credibility begin with the CompTIA
4:53
Security Plus because it covers the core
4:55
security Concepts and then go through
4:56
the AWS certifications practitioner
4:59
solution arit associate professional and
5:01
also the security speciality because
5:04
that one stands out in the class
5:05
security industry specifically for AWS
5:08
Cloud security roles now you are ready
5:10
for phase two build if you really want
5:12
to land a job in Cloud security then
5:14
learning theory isn't enough I get so
5:17
many applications come through every
5:18
week and when I check people's resumés
5:20
they are just listing their degrees and
5:22
certificates that they've completed but
5:23
they lack hands-on experience to really
5:26
excel in the build phase you have to not
5:28
only apply the the you've learned but
5:30
actually be creative and build real
5:33
solutions that businesses need in 2025
5:35
eventually you'll have to integrate AI
5:37
machine learning into your projects you
5:39
can't just build a static website a file
5:41
backup system an s3e privacy Checker and
5:44
believe that is enough to land a job are
5:46
they good starting points sure but I'm
5:48
here to give you the reality of the job
5:50
market and the industry you are already
5:52
fighting an uphill battle if you have no
5:55
prior industry experience so this is the
5:57
way to get your foot in the door by
5:59
building building more complex projects
6:01
to Showcase you know what you are doing
6:03
remember I quit my job and landed a new
6:06
run as a cloud engineer 5 years ago and
6:08
that would never have been possible if I
6:10
didn't build real projects and get
6:12
hands-on experience and of course it's
6:14
not easy you have plenty of roadblocks
6:16
along the way but to me everything in
6:19
life that's worth having isn't easy to
6:21
accomplish otherwise every single person
6:23
and a dog will be successful I can't
6:25
stress this enough building Hands-On
6:27
projects as soon as possible will
6:29
accelerate your Learning Journey because
6:31
it reinforces the theory it also gives
6:33
you the confidence to believe in what
6:35
you are doing you can apply for jobs
6:37
because you've been building and using
6:39
the tools that employers want to see for
6:41
the last few months so the build phase
6:43
is split into two parts part one you'll
6:45
be learning practical skills part two
6:47
you'll be building projects so part one
6:50
the practical skills that you need to
6:51
learn get familiar with awss fre ec2 for
6:55
running applications and go over
6:56
identity and access management for
6:57
controlling access again and of course
6:59
don't forget vpcs now these core
7:01
services will let you securely store
7:03
host and manage access to your services
7:06
learn how to use Python to automate
7:08
tasks like uploading files and setting
7:10
up servers learn basic commands like get
7:12
in it get add get commit get push to
7:15
keep track of changes in your code use
7:17
GitHub to store your projects and build
7:19
your portfolio now I also recommend
7:21
getting familiar with monitoring tools
7:22
like AWS guard Duty and cloudwatch for
7:25
logging and setting up alerts when
7:27
something unusual happens in your Cloud
7:29
sec security environment learn cicd
7:31
pipelines automate processes that check
7:33
code quality and push updates to
7:35
customers tools like Jenkins and GitHub
7:37
actions make it easy for this to be
7:39
implemented learn how to use AWS cloud
7:41
formation or terraform to set up Cloud
7:44
Resources with code this makes it easy
7:46
to set up change and duplicate your
7:48
infrastructure as needed learn Docker to
7:50
package applications with all their
7:52
dependencies this keeps your application
7:54
consistent across different environments
7:57
add security scans to your cicd pipeline
7:59
with tools like Bandit for python this
8:01
helps you catch security issues early in
8:03
the process now it's time to build
8:05
projects project number one you're going
8:07
to host a secure website on s3e focusing
8:10
on permissions Automation and monitoring
8:12
with infrastructure code you want to set
8:14
up your s3e bucket and store your
8:16
website files in there whilst also
8:18
managing the access configure your IM
8:20
roles automate file uploads and
8:22
permission checks of python and an
8:23
enable guard duty to monitor for
8:25
security alerts use git to track changes
8:28
and document your project s on GitHub
8:30
now with your second project you're
8:31
going to deploy a web application on ec2
8:34
with network security automated
8:36
infrastructure and of course
8:37
infrastructure as code firstly you want
8:39
to use cloud formation to spin up your
8:41
ec2 and then deploy your python flask
8:43
app on your ec2 use security groups to
8:45
limit access to your resources so your
8:47
ec2 then you want to automate your
8:49
server setup like installing
8:50
dependencies then set up GitHub actions
8:52
for automated deployment of your python
8:55
app finally use clat for logging and
8:56
monitoring alerts and the final project
8:58
you're going to use Docker for
9:00
containerization and set up a cicd
9:02
pipeline with Security checks as always
9:04
start by defining your infrastructures
9:06
code for your container so you can use
9:08
ECS with AWS and then you want to
9:10
package your web app in a Docker
9:11
container and then use Bandit for python
9:14
Security checks you can also add
9:15
compliance checks to your pipeline and
9:18
then what you want to do is simulate an
9:19
incident and review your logs in
9:21
cloudwatch now if you like the sound of
9:24
these projects but you don't know how to
9:25
start building them then check out my
9:27
cloud engineer Academy you'll get plenty
9:30
of hands-on experience building projects
9:31
and access to a private Discord group
9:33
with over 300 Cloud students I also run
9:36
monthly live workshops as well at no
9:39
extra cost last month I run a class on
9:41
deploying AI models to AWS so if you're
9:44
interested go check out the link in the
9:46
description so you've learned all the
9:47
skills and built the projects along the
9:49
way now you are ready for phase number
9:51
three own the first part of phase number
9:54
three is landing your Cloud security job
9:56
there is of course a lot of cloud
9:58
security jobs out there and this is
10:00
where you'll build your foundation when
10:02
you get your job you'll gain real
10:03
experience and develop core cloud and
10:06
security skills now even if you have to
10:08
take adjacent roles that's not a cloud
10:10
security engineer then just take it just
10:12
get your foot in the door now specific
10:15
job advice and interview tips I'm not
10:17
going to cover in this video instead I'm
10:18
going to teach you how to own what you
10:20
do but what does that even mean to me if
10:23
you want to own and dominate and I knew
10:25
this from day one back when I was 19
10:27
working as an apprentice you need to to
10:29
work for yourself own your future own
10:32
your projects own your time now some
10:34
people want to work at 9 to5 retire when
10:36
they're 65 and that's totally fine they
10:38
don't want to dominate but that's not
10:40
you your goal isn't to work your whole
10:42
life for someone else instead you're
10:44
going to use that time to strategically
10:46
learn specialize and eventually work for
10:49
yourself the thought of having to ask
10:50
your boss for a holiday should give you
10:53
enough desire to want to work for
10:55
yourself and for your own future so you
10:57
can take time off whenever you want like
10:59
I knew I could take my security and
11:01
Cloud expertise and build my own cloud
11:03
security consultancy and you can do the
11:05
same you don't have to reinvent the whe
11:07
Niche down as well maybe it's identity
11:09
and access management network security
11:11
or Ai and ml security whatever it is I
11:14
used to wake up at 5 a.m. to work on
11:16
cloud security before my 9 to-5 job then
11:18
spend my evenings building my YouTube
11:20
channel was it exhausting of course it
11:22
was but I knew the alternative was that
11:24
I'd be stuck in my 9 to-5 job forever
11:26
whereas this would only be temporary
11:28
pain that's why growing my YouTube
11:30
channel and Linkedin has given me so
11:32
much leverage your personal brand
11:35
multiplies everything that you do and
11:37
when you stick with it even on days when
11:38
you are dead tired your personal brand
11:41
is working in the background for you
11:43
recruiters reach out to you directly
11:45
people want to work with you you become
11:47
a trusted voice of authority in your
11:49
Niche why do you think recruiters reach
11:51
out to me every single day yes I have a
11:55
lot of experience if I'm not creating
11:57
content and posting on LinkedIn every
11:59
every single day then they don't see me
12:01
they don't even know who I am why do you
12:03
think Mark Zuckerberg is suddenly
12:05
creating content you're seeing his face
12:07
everywhere now because billionaires know
12:09
the true value of a personal brand in a
12:12
world where AI is developing faster than
12:14
we could ever imagine don't forget your
12:16
employer ultimately doesn't care about
12:19
you you're just there to make them as
12:20
much money as possible for as long as
12:22
you can as soon as you can be replaced
12:24
they won't hesitate that's why you need
12:27
to own something that's truly yours
12:30
something that gives you the freedom to
12:32
work on your own terms something that
12:34
rewards all those early mornings and
12:36
late nights the journey isn't easy but I
12:39
promise you it's worth every single step
12:42
and if you want a deeper step-by-step
12:44
breakdown then check out this video
12:45
right here where I explain the cloud
12:47
career path that will make you filthy
12:49

How to Secure Your AWS Environment: A Step-by-Step Guide

If you're building your business on the cloud, you know how important it is to keep your cloud environments secure. In today's digital world, a single security breach can be catastrophic, leading to data loss, reputational damage, and financial impact. 


0:00
if you're building your business on the
0:01
cloud you know how important it is to
0:04
keep your Cloud environment secure in
0:06
today's Digital World a single security
0:08
breach can be catastrophic leading to
0:11
data loss reputational damage and
0:14
financial impact but don't worry in this
0:16
video I'll walk you through the
0:18
actionable steps that you can take to
0:20
secure your Cloud environments and
0:22
protect your valuable assets we'll cover
0:24
everything from understanding the shared
0:26
responsibility model to implementing
0:29
strong identity and access management
0:31
securing your network architecture
0:32
encrypting your data and so much more
0:35
before we get started you should check
0:36
out my weekly Cloud newsletter where I
0:39
share free resources tutorials boot
0:41
camps and so much more helping you make
0:43
your Cloud move and also subscribe to
0:45
the channel because we're so close to
0:47
hitting our first 100,000 subscribers so
Shared Responsibility Model
0:50
first things first let's talk about the
0:52
shared responsibility model when you're
0:54
working with a cloud provider like AWS
0:57
security is a team effort your provider
1:00
is responsible for securing the
1:02
underlying infrastructure such as the
1:04
physical data centers the network and
1:06
the virtualization layer but when it
1:08
comes to securing your applications data
1:11
and access management that's completely
1:13
your responsibility a lot of Founders
1:16
and Tech teams make this mistake they
1:18
think that the cloud is secure by
1:21
default this is not the case you need to
1:23
understand the split responsibility
1:25
between you and the provider imagine you
1:28
are in a boat with your cloud provider
1:30
you're both responsible for keeping the
1:32
boat afloat and getting to your
1:34
destination safely but you have
1:36
different roles and responsibilities
1:38
your cloud provider is like the captain
1:40
of the ship they're responsible for the
1:42
underlying infrastructure making sure
1:45
the boat is sea worthy the engines are
1:48
running smoothly and the navigation
1:50
systems are working properly in Cloud
1:52
terms this means they take care of
1:54
things like the physical security of
1:55
data centers Network infrastructure and
1:57
security virtualization layer ensuring
2:00
the availability and resilience of the
2:02
cloud platform I.E your boat but here is
2:05
the Thing Once you are on the boat you
2:07
are responsible of your own safety and
2:10
the safety of your passengers in the
2:12
cloud your passengers are your
2:14
applications your data and your users so
2:17
it's up to you secure applications and
2:19
code manage access to your resources and
2:22
data configure your network and security
2:24
settings encrypt sensitive data and
2:26
ensure compliance and relevant
2:29
regulations and standards that is a lot
2:31
but think of it like this your cloud
2:33
provider will make sure the boat doesn't
2:35
sink but it's up to you to make sure
2:37
your passengers are wearing life jackets
2:40
you're not overloading the boat and
2:42
you're following the rules of the sea
2:45
now the specifics of the shared
2:46
responsibility model can vary depending
2:49
on the service model that you're using
Service Models
2:51
infrastructure as a service platform as
2:53
a service or software as a service with
2:56
infrastructure as a service you have the
2:58
most control and responsib ability
3:00
you're responsible for securing your
3:02
operating systems your applications and
3:04
your data whilst your cloud provider
3:06
takes care of the underlying
3:08
infrastructure this is like using Amazon
3:10
ec2s with platform as a service your
3:13
provider manages the operating system
3:15
the runtime but you're still responsible
3:17
for your applications and your data this
3:19
is more like using AWS Lambda or AWS
3:22
beant stock and with software as a
3:24
service your provider takes on most of
3:27
the responsibility managing everything
3:30
from the infrastructure to the
3:31
application layer but you are still
3:34
responsible for securing your data and
3:36
managing user access software as a
3:38
service in AWS is like using AWS
3:41
workspaces or work docs now no matter
3:44
which model that you're using it's
3:46
crucial to understand where your
3:49
responsibilities lie and to take a
3:51
proactive approach to security this
3:53
means clearly defining security roles
3:56
and responsibilities within your own
3:58
business implementing strong identity
4:00
and access management policies assessing
4:02
and monitoring your security posture and
4:05
staying up to dat with the latest
4:07
security practices and frat landscape
4:09
remember security is a shared
4:12
responsibility but it's ultimately up to
4:14
you to ensure the safety and security of
4:17
your applications and data in the cloud
Security
4:20
by understanding the shared
4:21
responsibility model and taking
4:23
ownership of your own security
4:25
responsibilities you can build and scale
4:28
on the cloud with conf confidence
4:30
knowing that you're doing everything in
4:32
your power to protect your business and
4:34
your customers and if you feel lost or
4:36
overwhelmed then drop me an email my
4:38
business so security helps secure Cloud
4:41
environments for businesses all over the
4:43
world and we can certainly help you do
4:45
the same now let's move on to the next
4:47
critical aspect of securing your Cloud
4:50
environment implementing strong identity
4:52
and access management think of I am like
4:54
the security system of a building it's
4:57
responsible for controlling who can
4:59
enter the building building which floors
5:00
and rooms they can access and what
5:03
actions they are allowed to perform once
5:05
they're inside the building getting I am
5:08
right is crucial because just like a
5:10
building you want to make sure only
5:12
authorized people are getting in and
5:15
they're not accessing areas that they
5:17
shouldn't so what are the best practices
Best Practices
5:19
for identity and access management first
5:22
and foremost you need to implement
5:23
multifactor authentication MFA is like
5:26
having a second form of verification to
5:28
enter the building it's not enough to
5:30
just have the key card which can be lost
5:32
or stolen you need another Factor like
5:35
biometric scanning or code sent to your
5:37
phone to prove you are exactly who you
5:40
say you are next you need to implement
5:42
leas privilege access this means giving
5:45
users the minimum level of access that
5:47
they need to do their job and nothing
5:49
more it's like having restricted areas
5:51
in the building not everyone needs
5:54
access to the Executive Suite or the
5:56
server room by restricting access to
5:58
sensitive resources and data you can
6:00
minimize the damage if an account is
6:03
compromised now it's also important to
6:05
review and audit user permissions often
6:09
people's roles and responsibilities can
6:11
change over time and you need to make
6:13
sure that access levels are adjusted
6:16
accordingly it's like keeping your
6:17
building's Access Control list up to
6:19
date you don't want to allow access to
6:21
someone who no longer works for your
6:24
company another key aspect of IM is
6:26
using role based Access Control this
6:28
allows you to Define roles within
6:31
specific permissions and assign users to
6:33
those roles it's like having different
6:35
job functions in the buildings managers
6:37
engineers and admin staff each with
6:40
their own specific areas of access and
6:43
responsibilities now the key is to be
6:45
thoughtful and deliberate in how you set
6:47
up your IM IM permissions don't just
6:49
give everyone admin access because it's
6:51
easier but it's also very lazy take the
6:54
time to define the roles and permissions
6:56
that align with your business needs and
6:58
security best practice ices and remember
7:00
IM am is not a oneandone task you need
7:03
to continuously Monitor and manage your
7:05
IM am Setup Review users and roll
7:08
permissions and make sure to remove
7:10
access for users who no longer need it
7:13
for example when an employee leaves your
7:16
company I've seen countless times where
7:18
ex employees still have access to
7:20
systems and applications even though
7:23
they left that business many many months
7:25
ago now let's talk about securing your
Network Architecture
7:28
network architecture imagine your Cloud
7:30
Network as a bustling City like New York
7:33
London or Dubai with data and services
7:37
constantly moving around like cars and
7:39
pedestrians just like a well-planned
7:41
city your network needs to be designed
7:44
with security in mind and from the
7:46
ground up the foundation of your secure
7:49
Cloud network is a VPC in AWS VPC is
7:53
your gated communities providing a
7:55
private and isolated environment for
7:58
your resources but just like a gated
8:00
community you need to carefully plan
8:02
your entry and your exit points as well
8:05
as your internal security measures when
8:07
you're setting up your VPC you should
8:09
Implement Network segmentation and
8:12
subnets this is like dividing your city
8:15
into different districts each with its
8:17
own security requirements you might have
8:20
a downtown subnet for your public facing
8:22
web service a residential subnet for
8:24
your internal databases and an
8:26
industrial subnet for your backend Pro
8:29
processing systems by segmenting your
8:31
network you can apply granular security
8:34
controls to each subnet this is like
8:37
having different security measures for
8:39
each district in your city your downtown
8:42
area might have surveillance cameras and
8:45
regular police patrols whilst your
8:47
residential area has neighborhood watch
8:49
programs and gated access in the cloud
8:52
these security controls are implemented
8:54
through security groups and network
8:56
access control list security groups are
8:59
like your buildings security system
9:01
controlling which traffic can enter and
9:04
exit each resource such as your servers
9:06
and your databases network access
9:09
control list are like the city
9:10
checkpoints controlling traffic between
9:13
subnets so between your residential area
9:16
and your downtown when configuring your
9:18
security groups and network access
9:20
control list you should follow the
9:21
principle of leas privilege this means
9:24
only allowing the minimum access
9:26
required for each resource to function
9:28
it's like only giving keys to specific
9:30
rooms a person needs access in a
9:33
building rather than the master key to
9:35
the entire complex another critical
9:38
aspect of network security is protecting
9:40
data in transit whenever data moves
9:43
across your network whether between your
9:45
subnets or in and out of your VPC is
9:47
exposed to potential interception and
9:50
tampering now to skew data in transit
9:53
you should use encryption protocols like
9:55
https for web traffic and vpns for
9:58
remote access https is like armoring
10:01
your cars protecting the passengers I.E
10:03
the data inside as they move across the
10:06
city VPN is like building secure tunnels
10:09
between buildings ensuring safe passage
10:12
for all fries Personnel but network
10:14
security doesn't stop at the boundaries
10:17
of your Cloud environment many
10:19
businesses run in a hybrid cloud model
10:22
with resources spread across public
10:24
Cloud private cloud and on premise
10:26
environments in this case you need to
10:28
ensure connectivity between these
10:30
different Cloud environments using a
10:32
service such as Direct Connect and
10:34
lastly let's not forget about the
10:36
outskirts of your city the internet
10:39
while your VPC provides a secure
10:41
internal environment you still need to
10:43
protect against external threats when
10:45
your resources communicate with the
10:47
outside world and this is where services
10:50
like AWS WAFF a web application firewall
10:53
can come into the picture these are like
10:55
your city's border of security
10:57
inspecting incoming traffic pick for
10:59
potential threats like SQL injection or
11:02
cross- site scripting attacks a w
11:05
provides an additional layer of security
11:07
for your public facing resources
11:09
securing your network architecture
11:12
requires a multi-layered approach much
11:15
like securing a city by using vpcs
Encryption
11:18
implementing Network segmentation and
11:20
access controls encrypting data in
11:22
transit ensuring secure hybrid
11:25
connectivity and protecting against
11:27
external web threats you can build a
11:29
robust and resilient network security
11:32
posture remember your network is the
11:34
backbone of your Cloud environment
11:36
investing time and effort into securing
11:39
it properly will pay off in the long run
11:41
providing a solid foundation for your
11:43
applications and your data now in
11:46
addition to securing your network you
11:48
also need to protect your data itself
11:50
through encryption encryption is like
11:52
putting your data in a safe even if
11:55
someone manages to get their hands on it
11:57
they won't be able to read it without
11:59
the key in the cloud you should encrypt
12:01
your data both at rest I.E when it's
12:03
stored and in transit when it's moving
12:06
across the network many Cloud providers
12:08
provide easy to ous encryption services
12:11
such as AWS KMS the Key Management
12:14
Service when setting up encryption is
12:16
best practice to use customer manage
12:19
keys this means you not your cloud
12:22
provider can control the encryption Keys
12:25
it's like keeping the key to your safe
12:27
yourself rather than giving it to
12:29
someone else to hold on to you should
12:31
also Implement secure key management
12:33
practices this includes rotating your
Monitoring Logging
12:35
encryption Keys often storing them
12:38
securely and tightly controlling access
12:41
to them finally to maintain the security
12:43
of your Cloud environment you need to
12:45
continuously Monitor and log all
12:48
activities monitoring and log in is like
12:50
having security cameras and guards
12:53
patrolling your building they keep an
12:55
eye out for any suspicious activities
12:57
and provide a record of everything that
13:00
happens in the cloud you should enable
13:02
logging for all critical resources and
13:05
activities this includes things like
13:07
user logins API calls resource
13:10
configurations and network traffic it's
13:12
also important to centralize your log
13:14
management and Analysis this is like
13:16
having your security cameras feed into a
13:19
single monitoring room by aggregating
13:21
your logs in a central location you can
13:23
more easily monitor for potential
13:25
security incidents across your entire
13:28
cloud environments now to help with this
13:30
consider using security information and
13:33
event management tools these are like AI
13:35
powered security systems that can
13:37
automatically detect unusual activities
13:40
and potential threats based on your logs
13:43
and your metrics finally make sure you
13:45
set up alerts and notifications for any
13:48
unusual or suspicious activities
13:50
detected by getting immediate alerts you
13:53
can quickly investigate and respond to
13:55
potential security incidents the key
13:57
with monitoring and logging is to be
13:59
proactive don't wait until security
14:02
incident happens to start looking at
14:04
your logs you want to review your logs
14:06
and monitor them often for any unusual
14:09
activities again you can set up alerting
14:12
and AI to monitor these on your behalf
14:15
even when everything seems to be running
14:17
smoothly building Security in your Cloud
14:19
environments takes time patience and
14:22
expertise but you are way better off
14:24
building with security at the start and
14:27
Security in mind to prevent any breaches
14:30
