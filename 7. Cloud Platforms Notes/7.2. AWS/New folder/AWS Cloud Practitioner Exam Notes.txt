1.2.  6 Benefits of Cloud Computing (Mnemonic: GOESTE):

Benefit	Description
Global Reach	Deploy anywhere in the world instantly
On-Demand	Access resources when you need them
Elasticity	Scale up/down based on demand
Speed	Deploy and build faster
Trade capital for operational expense	No upfront cost; pay for what you use
Economies of scale	AWS offers lower prices due to large-scale operations





1.3 Cloud Deployment Models

Model	Description
Public Cloud	Services offered over the public internet (e.g., AWS)
Private Cloud	Cloud infrastructure used by a single organization
Hybrid Cloud	Combination of on-prem and public cloud

1.4 Cloud Service Models

Model	Example	Description
IaaS	EC2, EBS, VPC	Basic building blocks (compute, network, storage)
PaaS	Elastic Beanstalk	Focus on deploying apps without managing infrastructure
SaaS	Gmail, Dropbox	Complete applications over the internet


________________________________________

1.5 Shared Responsibility Model (Introduction)
In AWS, security is a shared responsibility between the customer and AWS.
Responsibility Type	AWS is Responsible For	Customer is Responsible For
Security of the Cloud	Physical infrastructure, networking, data centers	—
Security in the Cloud	—	Data, IAM, OS configuration, encryption, apps
🔐 Tip: AWS protects the infrastructure; you secure what you build on top of it.




________________________________________
1.6 AWS Global Infrastructure
Component	Description
Region	A physical location in the world with multiple data centers (e.g., us-east-1)
Availability Zone (AZ)	A data center within a region — used for high availability and fault tolerance
Edge Locations	Content delivery points for Amazon CloudFront
Local Zones	Extend AWS services closer to end users in specific locations
Wavelength Zones	Bring AWS to mobile 5G networks
Outposts	Run AWS services in your own on-premises data center

🔐 Domain 2.1: Security and Compliance (30%)
________________________________________

Domain 2: Security and Compliance, covers the following: 
 - understanding shared responsibility, 
 - access control, 
 - compliance programs, 
 - and security support on AWS.


2.1 AWS Shared Responsibility Model

Responsibility Type	   | AWS is Responsible For		| Customer is Responsible For
Security of the Cloud	   | Hardware, software, networking, and facilities running AWS services
			   | Physical infrastructure, networking, hardware, global infrastructure	Data, identity, operating systems, applications, firewalls

			   | Customer is Responsible For
Security in the Cloud	   | IAM, patching, permissions, encryption, applications
			   | Data, IAM, OS configurations, encryption, applications

🧠 💡Key Tip:
● AWS secures the cloud infrastructure. 
● You secure your data, identity, applications, and configuration.
● AWS protects infrastructure; you protect what you run in it.

________________________________________
2.2 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

● IAM allows you to manage access to AWS services securely.

✅ Core IAM Concepts

Component	| Description
User		| Represents an individual account or service needing access
Group		| A collection of users with shared policies
Policy		| A JSON document that defines permissions (e.g., allow/deny access)
Role		| Grants temporary access to resources for AWS services or federated users
MFA		| Adds an extra layer of authentication using a device or app

🔐 IAM Best Practices:
● Use least privilege access
● Use roles for temporary access
● Enable MFA for all accounts
● Never use the root account for daily operations

________________________________________
2.3 AWS Organizations & Service Control Policies (SCPs)

🔷 AWS Organizations
 - Manage multiple AWS accounts from a single master account, 
	-...typically grouped by department or environment.

🔷 Service Control Policies (SCPs)
 - Used to define permission boundaries across your organization. 
 - They do not grant permissions — they only limit them.
 - Example: An SCP could restrict all accounts in a department from using certain services (e.g., EC2).
