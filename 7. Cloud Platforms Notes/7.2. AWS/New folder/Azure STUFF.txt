NOTES

1. Microsoft likes to be extremely particular with their questions and has a style of asking them, they also like to, in my opinion, ask things in a very stupid manner to try and trick you on occasion

2. Do the official practice questions. 
 - You'll see the button to start the practice quiz on the exam booking page. 
 - You can take it as many times as you want

3. Once you're confident you can score 80-90% consistently, book your exam (you need 70% to pass)

4. But this is the most important thing, once you're confident with the practice exams, you're set
