Cloud Engineer vs Cloud Architect - Which One Should You Choose?


In this video, I breakdown what these roles actually are, the salary ranges, essential skills, market demand and real job responsibilities.

At the end, I reveal which career path I recommend starting with first.


0:00
The cloud computing market is growing at
0:02
22% this year, reaching $980 billion.
0:06
It's one of the fastest growing
0:07
industries in tech, projected to exceed
0:09
$5 trillion in the next decade. Now,
0:12
this explosion is creating unprecedented
0:14
opportunities for anyone looking to
0:17
break into the industry. And if you're
0:19
considering a career in the cloud, then
0:21
you've probably found yourself stuck
0:23
between these two different paths: cloud
0:25
engineer or cloud architect. The
0:27
question is which one should you choose
0:30
and is the conventional wisdom about
0:32
these career paths actually setting you
0:35
up for failure? I'm Slayon. I've worked
0:37
in tech for a decade and are on my own
0:39
cloud security consultancy. Now through
0:41
my academy I've helped more than 500
0:44
students learn cloud and AI with my
0:46
first principles blueprint for
0:48
engineers. I've personally worked in
0:49
both of these roles. So, in this video,
0:52
I'll reveal what they involve, the
0:54
skills that you need, and the salaries
0:56
that you could expect because by the end
0:57
of this video, you'll know exactly which
1:00
path aligns best with your own personal
1:02
goals. Now, before we dive deep, I need
1:04
to clarify something. There's often
1:06
confusion about what these titles
1:09
actually mean. Cloud engineers are
1:10
hands-on implementers. They are actually
1:13
building and deploying cloud
1:14
infrastructure. Cloud architects focus
1:16
more on the design side of things.
1:18
They're architecting the systems that
1:19
cloud engineers will then go and deploy.
1:22
Now, you may have heard of a solutions
1:23
architect as well. They focus more on
1:25
the highlevel business strategy. In
1:28
terms of career progression, it
1:29
typically looks like this. You go from
1:31
cloud engineer to senior cloud engineer
1:33
to cloud architect and then finally you
1:35
go to solutions architect. Now that we
1:38
understand the landscape, let's dive
1:39
into what these two roles actually
1:41
involve. Cloud engineers are very much
1:44
hands-on implementers who build and
1:46
maintain cloud infrastructure. When
1:48
Netflix needs to handle millions of user
1:50
streaming simultaneously, cloud engines
1:52
will build the autoscaling
1:53
infrastructure that makes that possible.
1:55
When a startup needs to deploy their
1:57
applications globally, cloud engineers
1:59
will configure the networking, the
2:01
security, the compute resources to make
2:03
all of this happen. Now, as a cloud
2:05
engineer, a typical day can involve
2:07
things like this. Debugging network
2:08
issues between services. So, when
2:10
different parts of an application can't
2:11
talk to each other properly, you figure
2:13
out what's blocking the communication
2:14
and then you fix it. Maybe you spend
2:16
some time optimizing cloud costs by
2:18
right- sizing instances, making sure the
2:21
company that you're working for isn't
2:22
paying for more computing power than
2:24
they actually need. Or you'll be
2:26
automating deployment processes that
2:27
were previously done manually, which is
2:29
setting up CI/CD pipelines so that when
2:31
developers finish coding some features,
2:34
their work can automatically get pushed
2:36
to production instead of someone having
2:37
to do this by hand each time. So you're
2:40
basically saving time. Now, as you can
2:42
tell, it requires a deep technical skill
2:44
set, particularly in one cloud platform.
2:46
Now, I recommend AWS because it's the
2:48
industry leader. So, you'll need to
2:50
master the core services, EC2, S3, VPC,
2:54
IM, along with infrastructures code
2:56
tools like Terraform or Cloud Formation.
2:57
You also need strong scripting abilities
2:59
in Python and Bash, which are essential.
3:02
Plus, you need experience with CI/CD
3:04
tools like Jenkins or GitHub actions.
3:06
Now, career-wise, cloud engineers
3:08
typically start earning around $100,000
3:10
a year. And as you start to gain
3:11
experience, you can comfortably earn
3:13
over $200,000. But what happens when you
3:17
want to move beyond just implementing
3:18
solutions to actually designing them?
3:20
And that's where cloud architects come
3:22
into the picture. They operate at a
3:25
completely different level to cloud
3:26
engineers. While cloud engineers focus
3:28
on implementation, architects focus on
3:30
highlevel system design and strategic
3:32
technology decisions. For example, when
3:35
a company like Airbnb needs to scale to
3:37
handle millions of global users, cloud
3:39
architects design how services will
3:41
communicate, how data will flow between
3:43
different systems, and how the platform
3:45
will stay online even when individual
3:47
components fail. When I was working as a
3:49
cloud architect, my role completely
3:51
changed overnight. Although I could
3:53
build the actual infrastructure
3:54
hands-on, that was no longer expected of
3:56
me. In terms of a typical day in the
3:58
life of a cloud architect, it involves
4:00
meeting stakeholders to understand
4:02
business requirements, sitting down and
4:03
figuring out what problems that they
4:05
need technology to solve and what
4:06
constraints that they're working with
4:08
because everyone is working under a set
4:10
of constraints. You'll be creating
4:11
system design documents, basically
4:13
drawing blueprints that show how all the
4:15
technical pieces will work together. You
4:17
might be reviewing technical proposals
4:18
from engineering teams and making
4:20
decisions about technology standards. to
4:22
choosing which tools and which
4:24
approaches that the entire organization
4:26
will use ensuring that everything is
4:29
working together smoothly towards a
4:31
longerterm strategy. Essentially, cloud
4:33
architects focus on the big picture
4:35
which requires a skill set that goes
4:36
beyond pure technical knowledge. Yes,
4:38
you need deep understanding of cloud
4:40
services and system design patterns, but
4:42
you also need business acumen and the
4:44
ability to make technical decisions that
4:46
align with business objectives. Salary
4:48
wise, cloud architects typically start
4:50
around $140 to $180,000 and experienced
4:53
architects can earn anything between
4:55
$200 to $300,000 at large companies.
4:58
Now, here is something critical that
4:59
many people don't understand about this
5:01
career progression. You cannot become a
5:03
cloud architect without first being a
5:05
cloud engineer with hands-on
5:07
implementation experience. Now I know
5:09
there might be some people on YouTube
5:10
that tell you they were a cloud
5:11
architect or they are looking to become
5:14
an architect first. But when you see
5:16
things like this and you hear things
5:18
like this, you have to think logically
5:20
so it makes sense. How can you design
5:22
solutions if you've never implemented
5:24
anything yourself? How can you
5:26
understand the practical constraints and
5:28
challenges if you've only worked with
5:29
theoretical concepts? When I was working
5:31
as a cloud architect, my background as a
5:34
cloud engineer was invaluable. I could
5:36
spot potential problems in architectural
5:37
designs because I had debugged similar
5:40
issues in production. I understand which
5:42
solutions look good on paper, but which
5:44
one would be nightmares to maintain in
5:46
production environments and how it would
5:48
work operationally. Most importantly,
5:50
when I presented architectural designs
5:52
to engineering teams, I had the
5:53
credibility because they knew I'd
5:56
actually build and maintain similar
5:57
systems. You can't get hired as a cloud
5:59
architect without significant hands-on
6:01
experience. So if you're just starting
6:03
out, the path seems very clear. You want
6:06
to begin as a cloud engineer and you
6:07
want to build deep technical expertise
6:09
before moving to more senior roles like
6:11
a cloud architect. So don't fall for it.
6:14
There's no such thing as a junior cloud
6:16
architect. It doesn't exist in the real
6:18
world. Okay? It just doesn't, right? No
6:21
one is hiring real junior architects and
6:24
assigning them to clients so they can
6:25
make big strategic decisions. And trust
6:27
me, I know I've worked with many
6:29
organizations from Fortune 500s to
6:31
startups to government agencies. But
6:33
anyway, this traditional linear
6:35
progression is being disrupted by
6:37
something most people haven't even
6:39
noticed yet because there's something
6:40
happening in 2025 that's fundamentally
6:43
changing these traditional career paths.
6:45
Now, the boundaries between a cloud
6:47
engineer and a cloud architect are
6:49
slowly dissolving. And a big driving
6:51
factor of this is AI. Companies are
6:53
realizing that engineers can be way more
6:55
efficient today and get more done with
6:58
way less time. So naturally, they expect
7:00
you to have a more well-rounded skill
7:02
set. So this is creating opportunities
7:04
for a specific type of engineer. Let me
7:06
explain. When I look at the most
7:07
successful people in tech today, Elon
7:10
Musk, Jensen Huang, Sund Pachai, Satia
7:12
Nadella, these big-time CEOs, they all
7:14
have one thing in common. They are all
7:16
what I call technical leaders. They
7:19
understand technology deeply enough to
7:21
make strategic decisions, but they also
7:23
understand business and implementation
7:25
realities. Take Elon Musk as the perfect
7:27
example. Now, whether you like him or
7:29
not, before becoming the CEO of Tesla
7:31
and SpaceX, he was hands-on engineering.
7:33
At SpaceX, he taught himself rocket
7:36
engineering and was personally involved
7:38
in designing the Falcon 1 rocket. At
7:40
Tesla, he understood both the software
7:43
and the hardware engineering and the
7:44
challenges of electric vehicles. This
7:47
true engineering background is exactly
7:49
why he can make strategic decisions that
7:51
other CEOs simply cannot do. When SpaceX
7:53
needed to reduce cost, he understood the
7:55
technical constraints well enough to
7:57
give specific engineering solutions like
7:59
reusable rockets. These guys are no
8:01
longer just visionaries. Long gone are
8:03
the days where CEOs of big tech
8:05
companies can just be business people.
8:07
You need technical understanding and
8:09
real implementation skills which all of
8:11
these leaders have in common. And I see
8:13
a similar pattern emerging in cloud. The
8:16
engineers who are absolutely crushing it
8:18
in today's market aren't just pure cloud
8:20
engineers or pure cloud architects. They
8:22
are technical leaders who can operate
8:24
effectively at both of these levels.
8:26
These are people who can just sit in a
8:28
boardroom and explain to executives why
8:31
a particular architectural approach will
8:33
save the company $2 million annually.
8:35
And then they can just go back to their
8:37
desk and actually build the solution
8:39
that they've just proposed. They
8:41
understand business requirements deeply
8:43
enough to design the appropriate
8:44
solutions. but they also have the
8:46
technical skills to validate that their
8:48
designs actually work in practice. And
8:50
because of this combined skill set,
8:52
these engineers will just make more
8:54
money as well. And that's exactly why
8:56
inside of my academy, I teach my
8:58
students system design and cloud
9:00
architecture principles from day one.
9:02
Not because I expect them to become
9:04
cloud architects immediately. But it's
9:06
more about the fact that when you
9:07
understand system design principles, you
9:10
just make better architectural decisions
9:12
and then ending up building way better
9:14
cloud solutions. This approach gives you
9:16
the launch pad to become a technical
9:17
leader from the very beginning of your
9:19
career. And they don't teach you this on
9:20
Udemy or anywhere in YouTube in fact. So
9:23
how do you become one of these technical
9:24
leaders? It starts with a fundamental
9:26
mindset shift about how you approach
9:28
these problems. Most engineers think in
9:30
terms of how do I implement this? Most
9:32
architects think in terms of what should
9:34
the design actually look like. But
9:36
technical leaders think differently. And
9:38
here is how you can implement that shift
9:40
today. For every technical project that
9:42
you complete, ask yourself questions
9:43
like this. What business problem does
9:46
this solve? How does this create value
9:48
for the organization? What would happen
9:50
if this system failed? How does this fit
9:52
into the broader technical strategy for
9:54
the company? First, it makes you
9:55
dramatically more valuable because you
9:57
can connect technical work to business
9:59
outcomes. Secondly, it accelerates your
10:01
career progression because you're
10:02
already thinking like a senior
10:04
professional from day one, even while
10:06
building foundational technical skills.
10:08
Now, you're probably asking, "What does
10:09
all of this mean for your career
10:11
choice?" My recommendation is not to
10:13
choose between cloud engineer and cloud
10:14
architect. Don't box yourself into one
10:17
title because at every company, titles
10:19
mean slightly different things. Instead,
10:21
become a technical leader who can
10:22
operate at both levels and acquire a
10:24
well-rounded skill set. And this matters
10:26
because let's say you land a job at a
10:28
big tech company like AWS. They're going
10:30
to expect you to think strategically and
10:32
understand the business side of things,
10:34
even as a cloud engineer. But maybe you
10:36
want to work at a startup instead, which
10:38
is fine. But guess what? You're probably
10:40
going to be the only cloud person in a
10:42
team of five. They need you to design
10:44
the system and build it, the jack of all
10:47
trades. And who knows, maybe one day you
10:49
want to start your own company. And I've
10:50
done that many times. But you can do
10:52
that when you can spot a real problem in
10:54
the market and actually have the skills
10:55
to build the solution yourself. That's
10:57
where the real magic happens because
10:59
most people don't think like this. They
11:00
are stuck in the I'm either this or I'm
11:03
either that mentality. But the people
11:05
making the real money with the most
11:06
opportunities, well, they simply blur
11:08
those lines. So, if you want to learn
