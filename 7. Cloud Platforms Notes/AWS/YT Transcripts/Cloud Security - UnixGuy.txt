FASTEST way to become Cloud Security Engineer and ACTUALLY get a job â€“ UPDATED (2024)


0:00
someone in our Discord his name is Chad
0:02
asked me about the best way to become a
0:04
cloud security engineer I tried to
0:06
answer this question but I quickly
0:08
realize that the answer is not
0:09
straightforward because as a cloud
0:11
security engineer people expect you to
0:14
not only provide security
0:15
recommendations on how to secure the
0:17
cloud but they also want you to know how
0:19
to configure those security
0:21
recommendations and settings now having
0:23
said all of that cloud engineering and
0:25
cyber security are the two highest
0:27
growth carriers at the moment they offer
0:29
the highest salaries with lots and lots
0:31
of career progression and sometimes with
0:34
the option of remote work for some
0:35
organizations so to solve this issue I
0:38
created a step-by-step road map that
0:40
will give you the skills of both cloud
0:42
and cyber security in the fastest way
0:45
possible whether you have some cyber
0:46
security experience or some it
0:48
experience or if you're someone who's
0:50
brand new without a degree without any
0:52
it or coding or networking knowledge
0:55
this is the video breakdown but not only
0:57
that I will also be sharing with you the
1:00
top three mistakes that people make as
1:02
they are trying to become Cloud Security
1:04
Professionals let's get into it so we
1:05
need to start to build our foundation in
1:08
both cyber security and Cloud both at
1:10
the same time the best and quickest
1:12
start in my opinion is the Microsoft
1:15
cyber security analyst certification
1:17
because it will not only introduce you
1:19
to the basics and foundations of it
1:21
networking but it will also teach you
1:23
how to use the Azure Cloud which is the
1:25
Microsoft Cloud solution that it's
1:27
extremely popular in the industry this
1:29
search will cover your basis in terms of
1:31
General it knowledge and networking so
1:33
don't worry about doing things like comp
1:35
A+ or CCNA or Security Plus if you've
1:38
done those certifications that's
1:40
perfectly fine by the way these are good
1:42
skills to have but doing this
1:43
certificate will quickly introduce you
1:45
to those Concepts and give you what you
1:47
need to become a cloud security engineer
1:49
now I did a deep dive into this
1:50
certification in this video so you can
1:52
watch it for a more detailed view of the
1:54
certification but before we move on I
1:56
know you might have the question of so
1:58
what if I did the Google cyber security
2:00
certification do you still need to do
2:02
the Microsoft cyber security analyst
2:04
certification to be honest it really
2:06
depends if you feel like you're
2:07
confident with the foundational Concepts
2:09
you might be missing that introduction
2:11
to Microsoft Azure so I want you to
2:13
somehow learn the Microsoft Azure before
2:15
jumping into the next recommendation
2:17
alternatively you can still do the
2:19
Microsoft cyber security analyst even if
2:21
you've done the Google cyber security
2:22
certificate because it will give you a
2:24
chance to revisit those topics make sure
2:26
you understand them really well but
2:27
you'll also be able to finish it really
2:29
quickly and you will get a chance to
2:31
practice with the Microsoft Azure Cloud
2:33
now this is not the only reason I'm
2:34
recommending the Microsoft cyber analyst
2:36
certificate but the most important
2:38
reason is that at the end of this
2:39
certificate you get a free practice exam
2:42
for the Microsoft sc900 exam which is
2:45
the Microsoft security compliance and
2:47
identity fundamental certification this
2:49
way you can finish the Microsoft cyber
2:51
analyst certificate learn about cyber
2:53
security but also get an additional
2:54
certification from Microsoft that will
2:56
signal to potential employers that
2:58
you're someone who have Cloud security
3:00
skills that you are serious about
3:02
pursuing a career in Cloud security
3:04
while keeping in mind we are still at
3:05
the beginning of our journey but this is
3:08
where the fun really begins when we do
3:10
practical projects I don't want you just
3:12
to pass certifications especially
3:13
multiple choice certifications because
3:15
as I said in the beginning of the video
3:17
being a cloud security professional you
3:19
need to know how to configure those
3:21
security recommendations in the cloud
3:23
you can't theorize your way around it
3:25
and the best way to get those Hands-On
3:26
skills is by doing what we refer to as
3:29
guided projects those are projects
3:31
designed to get you to practice some of
3:33
the concepts that we see in the industry
3:34
but more importantly you get to improve
3:36
your confidence which will enable you to
3:38
apply to more jobs get into interviews
3:41
and land your first Cloud security job
3:43
the first project will get you to create
3:44
a virtual machine on the Microsoft Azure
3:47
cloud and you will deploy a web server
3:49
on that virtual machine it's a really
3:51
quick introductory project it will take
3:53
you two to four hours to finish but it's
3:55
a great classic project that even when I
3:57
was learning Unix long time ago one of
3:59
the first tasks that we used to do we
4:01
used to install a web server on a Linux
4:03
machine so now you get to do it in the
4:04
cloud similar concept not only that it
4:06
will get you more comfortable of
4:08
spinning your own Azure cloud and
4:10
configure and deploy things in the cloud
4:12
the second project that I want you to do
4:14
will get you to secure an SQL database
4:16
in the Microsoft Azure Cloud this is a
4:18
cloud security task and as you will see
4:21
when you do the project most
4:22
applications noway live in the cloud for
4:24
example your banking data is stored
4:27
somewhere on an application in the cloud
4:29
that the Bank owns which ultimately
4:31
resides in a database so this is a
4:33
crucial task that you will be performing
4:35
as a cloud security engineer and it will
4:37
look great on your resume or your CV and
4:39
this is how I want you to add it on your
4:41
CV so under a section called skills add
4:43
these keywords to your CV and then have
4:46
another section called projects where
4:48
you have bullet items for each project
4:50
that you did I know many people get so
4:52
concerned about HR filters and keywords
4:54
well these are keywords having Microsoft
4:56
Azure or SQL Security on your CV is
4:59
something we look for as hiring managers
5:01
so trust me with this one guided
5:03
projects is the single best thing that
5:05
you will do for your career and your
5:06
development and this brings me to the
5:08
first mistake that people make when
5:10
they're trying to land their first Cloud
5:12
security job people tend to do a lot of
5:14
intermediate and even sometimes Advanced
5:16
certifications that are multiple choice
5:18
based Without Really spending the time
5:20
configuring things in the cloud this
5:22
will lead to a lot of bad habits but you
5:24
will also tend to forget a lot of the
5:26
stuff that you learn but a lot of the
5:27
things that you memorize to pass the
5:29
exam will not make any sense to you
5:31
things will only make sense when you put
5:33
them to practice only when you get to
5:35
configure these settings and configure
5:36
these security recommendations that all
5:38
of this Theory will make sense to you
5:40
now in this part we will do a deep dive
5:42
into securing the cloud and we will pass
5:45
an intermediate SL Advanced Cloud
5:47
security certification the Microsoft
5:49
Azure security engineer associate is a
5:51
fantastic certification for you because
5:53
the topic of this certification pretty
5:55
much mirrors the tasks that you will do
5:57
as a cloud security engineer so so this
5:59
certification is probably the one that
6:01
will prepare you the most to perform
6:03
Cloud security engineering tasks this is
6:05
a fantastic training that will prepare
6:07
you to pass this certification it
6:09
includes a practice test at the end but
6:11
not only that it is full of
6:13
opportunities to practice all these
6:15
Concepts in a lab so you'll get to spin
6:16
up Microsoft azour cloud and you'll get
6:18
to configure all of these security
6:20
settings because as you're applying all
6:22
of these Concepts in a practical
6:24
environment things will make sense all
6:26
of these concept that you've learned
6:27
will get reemphasized which will make
6:29
you a lot more confident in an interview
6:32
setting because you will know what
6:33
you're talking about you can quickly
6:34
come up with scenarios because you've
6:36
done them practically so if we look at
6:38
the content of the certification part
6:40
one is secure access with azour active
6:42
directory azour ad is the domain
6:44
controller that lives in the cloud there
6:46
is 100% chance that you will run into
6:48
active directory as a cyber security
6:50
professional so this part will cover
6:52
this really nicely for you it will show
6:54
you what an azour security engineer do
6:56
it will tell you a little bit about the
6:58
azour 500 exam that you will pass after
7:00
this course and then it will do a deep
7:02
dive into azour active directory then
7:04
you will explore how to manage user
7:06
access within the aure ad in fact last
7:09
month I was helping an organization that
7:11
got compromised and upon investigation
7:13
we found that the reason that they were
7:14
compromised was without user permissions
7:16
and identity in general in the cloud was
7:18
not configured properly this happens a
7:21
lot more than you think people spin up
7:23
these Cloud instances without spending
7:25
enough time and resources into securing
7:27
users and permissions which are all done
7:29
using azour ad you will also get to
7:31
configure multiactor authentication and
7:33
passwordless authentication again these
7:36
are all Concepts we ask about in the
7:38
interviews and then at the end of the
7:39
first module you have a project to
7:41
practice everything that you've learned
7:43
part two is identify protection and
7:45
governance this is another Deep dive
7:47
into identity and access within the
7:49
cloud again extremely important topic
7:51
within the cloud and one that I see
7:53
organizations struggle with the most so
7:55
the fact that you're getting proficient
7:57
with this at this part of your career is
7:59
extremely valuable you will also get
8:01
introduced to some fairly advanced
8:03
concepts such as role based access
8:04
control and how to implement that in the
8:06
cloud you will also get to understand
8:08
privileged access management and how
8:10
this applies to Azure ad so as you can
8:12
see as you're going through it you are
8:14
learning fairly Advanced cyber security
8:16
Concepts and you're getting a chance to
8:18
applying them in the cloud this is
8:20
pretty much what a cloud security
8:21
professional does and as you can see
8:23
this is why Cloud Security Professionals
8:25
get paid High salaries because they need
8:27
a lot of skills they need to be
8:28
comfortable with a lot of Technologies
8:30
and there is always demand for cyber
8:32
Security Professionals with Cloud skills
8:34
the third part is called Implement
8:36
platform protection this is where you'll
8:38
get to reinforce some of the network
8:40
security Concepts that you've learned
8:41
earlier in your Microsoft cyber security
8:43
analyst so you'll get to learn how to
8:45
configure firewalls within the cloud and
8:47
what that means within the context of
8:49
cloud and also some advanced concepts
8:51
such as defense in depth you may have
8:53
heard about it you may have learned it
8:55
but here you'll get to see how it's
8:56
actually applied in the real world in
8:58
the Microsoft Azure cloud and then
9:00
you'll get to configure kubernetes again
9:02
you may have not heard of this before
9:04
but kubernetes is something that cloud
9:06
Engineers know and are familiar with so
9:08
you will get introduced to that but not
9:10
just from an engineer point of view but
9:12
from a cyber security point of view if
9:13
you get a chance to work in a large
9:15
environment and their use cities you
9:17
will be the one who will secure that for
9:19
the organization course 4 goes through
9:21
application security but within a cloud
9:23
context so in the cloud we deploy
9:26
applications as the cloud security
9:28
professional you are not the one who
9:29
deploys these applications but you are
9:31
the one who configur security for those
9:33
applications and this includes
9:35
encryption in those application and how
9:36
to exchange and store those encryption
9:39
Keys you'll also get introduced to API
9:41
and API Security in fact there was a
9:43
high-profile company that got hacked in
9:46
Australia and the way that got hacked is
9:48
through insecure apis so in this course
9:50
you'll get introduced to what apis are
9:53
and how to secure them and course five
9:55
is all about securing data address and
9:57
in that again you will go through
9:59
encryption but you'll also go through
10:00
how to secure the SQL database which
10:03
you've got some practice with in the
10:04
Practical project that I introduced
10:06
earlier so here you get a chance to
10:08
explore this in a broader sense course
10:10
six is managing security operations this
10:12
is the bread and butter of cyber analyst
10:14
so if you're a cyber security
10:16
professional who deals with stopping
10:17
cyber attacks detecting cyber attacks
10:20
well a huge part of detecting and
10:21
stopping cyber attacks is the cloud
10:23
because many if not most of those
10:25
attacks nowadays happen in the cloud so
10:27
here you'll get introduced to some of
10:28
the Microsoft Solutions on how to detect
10:30
cyber attacks such as the Azure Monitor
10:33
and Microsoft Defender you will also get
10:35
introduced to Microsoft Sentinel which
10:37
is a seam similar to Splunk in fact it's
10:39
becoming increasingly popular so this is
10:41
a fantastic chance to learn Sentinel and
10:44
practice with Microsoft Sentinel you
10:45
will even get a chance to do some threat
10:47
hunting so if you haven't done threat
10:49
modeling or threat hunting and you don't
10:51
even know what there is this course will
10:53
teach you these concept but it will also
10:54
teach you how to perform them in the
10:56
cloud and then in course seven you will
10:58
get a practice exam exam to pass your B
11:00
at 500 exam again extremely popular exam
11:03
highly in demand you can get a really
11:05
nice job after passing this exam and
11:07
doing the stuff that I've mentioned
11:08
earlier but not only that there is a
11:10
Capstone project which is my favorite
11:12
part of the course because you get to
11:14
put all of these Concepts together and
11:16
you get to implement them using a
11:17
Hands-On project now in part four I want
11:19
to show you the different careers within
11:22
Cloud security noticed I've used the
11:24
word engineer in the title of this video
11:26
because the way Cloud security
11:27
professional are viewed is that they are
11:29
Cloud Engineers who understand cyber
11:31
security they are individuals who know
11:33
how to set up the cloud how to configure
11:35
the cloud but they have deep
11:37
understanding of cyber security and they
11:39
know how to implement those cyber
11:41
security recommendations within the
11:42
cloud now broadly speaking there are
11:44
three specializations within the cloud
11:46
the first one and the most common one is
11:48
the one that I explained where you are a
11:50
cloud security engineer you implement
11:52
security recommendations within the
11:54
cloud now the second one a cyber
11:56
security consultant where you advise
11:58
different organiz ations on cyber
12:00
security issues and as part of your job
12:02
you may be asked to advise organizations
12:05
on cloud security issues in fact this is
12:07
what I do I'm not a cloud security
12:09
specialist but I'm a cyber security
12:11
consultant and a lot if not all of my
12:13
clients use the cloud in one way shape
12:15
or form so I end up needing to have
12:17
conversations with them about the cloud
12:19
I give them Cloud recommendations I do
12:21
Cloud assessments and by the way I did a
12:23
really nice day in my life as a cyber
12:25
security consultant in this video if
12:26
you're curious on what my day looks like
12:29
and the third one you could be like I
12:30
said a dedicated cyber security analyst
12:33
who work in an organization and your job
12:35
is to respond to attacks to threats
12:37
you're more of a blue team professional
12:39
but as part of your job you will need to
12:41
deal with the cloud so you will need
12:43
Cloud security as a skill not
12:45
necessarily A specialization for example
12:47
you might be dealing with a Cyber attack
12:49
against an application that lives in the
12:51
cloud so you will need to understand how
12:53
the cloud works so you can analyze that
12:55
attack and perhaps stop that attack in a
12:57
bigger organization you could be a cyber
12:59
analyst specializing in the cloud but
13:01
more often than not you're usually a
13:02
blue team professional or a cyber
13:04
analyst who looks after the cloud as
13:06
part of their job which brings me to the
13:08
second mistake that people make with
13:09
Cloud security which is being extremely
13:12
narrow in their job search this one
13:14
actually drives me crazy so they'll do
13:16
the certification they will study hard
13:18
they will do all the hard work but when
13:19
it comes to job search they insist that
13:21
they want to perform an exact job they
13:23
have this imaginary job where all they
13:25
do is just designing Security in the
13:27
cloud so unless the title says design
13:30
Security in the cloud they don't apply
13:32
they don't like it or for example they
13:33
get hired as Cloud security professional
13:36
but then the actual job doesn't match
13:38
the imaginary job description they had
13:39
in mind and this is a recipe of not only
13:42
failing in your Cloud security career
13:44
but also it's recipe to be perpetually
13:46
upset and unhappy so what I really want
13:48
you to do is to just be a little bit
13:50
more flexible with your approach and
13:52
understand that cloud security can be
13:54
its own specialization but it can also
13:56
be a skill that you get to use as a
13:58
cyber security professional and that
14:00
sometimes the job is not what you
14:01
imagine it's not possible for the job to
14:03
be exactly what you want it to be every
14:05
single day sometimes you'll get to work
14:07
on exciting things but other times you
14:09
will have to do some boring tedious
14:11
things we all have to do it I have to do
14:13
it that's just the world we live in so
14:15
be a little bit more flexible now you
14:17
put water into a
14:18
cup it becomes the cup you put water
14:21
into a bottle it becomes the bottle you
14:23
put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot
14:26
now water can flow or it in
14:29
Crash be water my friend now in part
14:33
five I want you to expand your knowledge
14:35
at this point you might be wondering why
14:37
did I choose Microsoft Azure what about
14:39
Amazon AWS what about the Google Cloud
14:42
what about the Oracle Cloud well
14:43
remember in this video I'm trying to get
14:45
you the fastest way possible for you to
14:47
build the skills of cyber security and
14:49
Cloud at the same time it just so
14:51
happened that the training available
14:53
that goes over Microsoft is just a
14:55
little bit higher quality than the ones
14:56
available for AWS that's not to to say
14:58
the AWS training is bad it's great it
15:01
might just take you a little bit longer
15:03
to familiarize with this concept
15:04
especially if you're someone with no it
15:06
degree or with no technolog and you
15:08
trying to change careers from a
15:10
different career into cyber security Now
15:12
the good news if you've done all of the
15:13
certifications that have recommended so
15:15
far you'll be very confident with
15:17
Microsoft Azure the skills are extremely
15:19
transferable the concepts are exactly
15:21
the same the only difference is the
15:23
naming convention so the name of the
15:24
storage instance with an Azure is
15:26
different in AWS it's called S3 bucket
15:28
it's just different namings for the same
15:30
thing which means the best way for you
15:32
to learn Amazon AWS is through guided
15:35
projects notice I want you to do
15:37
projects with Amazon AWS before even
15:40
doing any trainings I want you to think
15:42
like an engineer I want you to think on
15:44
your feed and try to research topics
15:46
that you don't know because this is what
15:47
happens in the real world we don't
15:49
always have training available for new
15:51
problems that we face and trust me
15:52
you'll have no problem finishing these
15:54
projects the first one to create a
15:56
virtual private Cloud within Amazon WS
15:59
again as you go through these projects
16:01
you will realize that you are already
16:03
familiar with what a VPC is it just has
16:05
a different name with Microsoft aure and
16:07
the second project is a hosting project
16:09
where you will host a web application on
16:11
an Amazon AWS very very similar to the
16:13
one that you did with Microsoft Azure
16:15
except you'll do it with AWS and you
16:17
will see how your skills are extremely
16:19
transferable and this way you will get
16:21
to add Amazon to AWS to your CV now the
16:23
popular certification from Amazon AWS
16:26
that I want you to pass is the AWS
16:28
security specialty it's equivalent to
16:30
the a 500 from Microsoft same difficulty
16:33
extremely similar topics unfortunately
16:35
there is no cheap training from corsera
16:37
that covers this the one that I used to
16:39
recommend is from acloud Guru which is
16:41
the one that I recommend today however
16:43
things have changed a cloud Guru got
16:45
acquired by plural sites so things are
16:48
not how they used to be but it's still
16:50
good quality if you've reached this
16:51
stage I highly recommend that you also
16:53
do this training because you'll get a
16:55
chance to review exactly the same topics
16:57
that you've learned with Microsoft
16:58
you'll get to apply the same concept
17:00
with an Amazon AWS which will improve
17:02
your confidence it will expand your
17:04
knowledge and will ultimately lead you
17:05
to land your first Cloud security job
17:08
now again the third one there is an
17:09
equivalent certification from Google
17:11
Cloud Google cloud is less popular than
17:13
Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS but it's
17:16
still widely used in the industry so
17:18
this one is optional if you have time
17:20
and you want to further expand your
17:21
Cloud knowledge good news is it's
17:23
available through corsera it's cheap to
17:25
complete it has practical project and it
17:27
has all the good stuff that you've done
17:29
in your Microsoft AO certificate just
17:31
with the Google Cloud again if you've
17:33
reached this stage you will be able to
17:35
finish this one quickly because you are
17:37
already familiar with all of these Cloud
17:39
security Concepts things will just have
17:41
slightly different names in the Google
17:43
Cloud but that's about it but this
17:44
brings me to the third biggest mistake
17:46
that people make with Cloud security is
17:48
that some individuals are wedded to one
17:51
technology they refer to themselves as
17:53
the AWS guy or the Azure girl they only
17:55
want to work with one technology they
17:57
want to specialize in AWS they want to
17:59
specialize in Microsoft Azure there is
18:01
nothing wrong with that but I think
18:02
you're missing out if you follow this
18:04
approach you're leaving a lot of
18:05
opportunities on the table as I've
18:07
explained all of these Cloud platforms
18:09
are extremely similar one is not better
18:11
than the other they pretty much do the
18:13
same things so in my opinion a
18:15
successful cyber security professional
18:17
is one who's adaptable is one who have
18:19
depth and bread of knowledge don't be
18:21
wed to one technology or one vendor
18:23
because vendors come and go and because
18:25
in the real world you will be asked to
18:27
deal with more than one technology so if
18:29
your organization for example brought up
18:31
Google cloud and they ask who knows
18:33
Google Cloud I want you to be the one to
18:35
put your hand up and say yes I will take
18:37
this opportunity on and this is how
18:39
you'll progress in your career this is
18:41
how I was able to jump up quickly how I
18:43
was able to learn quickly and how I was
18:45
able to have a breath of knowledge now
18:47
remember Cloud security is a
18:48
specialization but it's also a skill
18:50
that you can have as a cyber security
18:52
professional but if you're wondering
18:54
what other cyber security professional
18:55
specialization are like what do they do
18:58
well I broke them down all in this video
19:00
where I've listed every single cyber
19:01
security specialization I've listed the
19:03
task that they do what their day-to-day
19:05
look like but I also listed the pros and
19:07
cons of each specialization so please
19:10
watch this video and I'll see you there
