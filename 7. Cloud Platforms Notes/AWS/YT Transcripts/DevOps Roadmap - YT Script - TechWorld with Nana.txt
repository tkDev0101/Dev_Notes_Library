DevOps Roadmap - TechWorld with Nana


Overview - Dedicate 15 hours per week
0:00
in this video I want to give you the most detailed devops road map you can
0:06
ever get you could literally take this with the topics to cover and checklist
0:11
to work through with a weekly breakdown and have a full detailed road map for
0:17
Learning devops and we're giving it out for free really as a gift enjoy and I
0:23
hope this will be very helpful for you regardless of whether you enroll in our
0:28
Devil's Boot Camp or not you can take it and learn completely yourself I will be very happy to hear that as well and as I
0:36
said this is not only the topics or road map of devops what you need to learn but
0:41
also a weekly breakdown of the things in which order to learn what technologies
0:47
and Concepts and how much time you should invest on learning each new tool or Concept in this weekly breakdown that
0:54
we prepared actually assumes on average 15 hours time investment per week to
1:01
learn all these things because we know that a lot of people who learn devops are actually working Professional
1:07
Engineers with full-time jobs or some other full-time responsibilities so obviously they would not have 40 hours a
1:14
week to just dedicate on learning new stuff so they need to kind of make space and manage to upgrade their skills with
1:21
a limited number of hours per week and that's what we considered when creating this weekly schedule for not only
1:29
learning the devil Basics but really mastering devils and completely understanding every single concept all
1:35
the underlying details of every technology in develops and so on so what
1:41
I'm going to do now is I'm going to walk you through week by week what you need to learn why you need to learn these
1:47
things and why in this specific order so you not only understand what you're learning but what's the purpose behind
1:55
every single concept and Tool and why are they important for your engineering knowledge in depths so let's see what we
Month 1
2:02
need to cover in the first few weeks we start with Linux and operating systems
2:08
and you will be surprised how important Linux knowledge and generally
2:14
understanding the concepts of operating systems different distributions of server operating systems is for devop
2:20
engineers and also you'll be surprised how many working Professional Engineers
2:26
actually lack the skill set of Linux operating system systems bash scripting and so on so if you check out a lot of
2:34
devops job requirements Linux as well as bash scripting are both on the list of
2:41
required skill set for any devops engineer and as I said I know there are many Engineers like software developers
2:48
Solutions architects who never needed Linux for their work but in devops it's
2:54
absolutely essential and in the boot camp we work with servers the entire time we administer things like Nexus
3:02
server Jenkins so we install these tools on bare Cloud servers we install each
3:07
and every tool like terraform enable and work on command line interface to learn
3:13
these tools so knowing all this is basically just a absolute prerequisite
3:18
you cannot skip this part and as you see just in the first module of the boot camp you actually learn two required
3:25
skills of a Devo engineer pretty motivating right and the Linux module is
3:31
actually packed with so many Concepts that you need throughout devops to even
3:36
better understand different devops Technologies along the way for example
3:41
you learn everything about virtual machines SSH key management and usage you learn how to connect to Virtual
3:47
machines you learn about environment variables creating users and permissions on an operating system using package
3:54
manager tools to install various Linux packages obviously we learn shelf
3:59
scripting and even using beam command line editor various CLI commands of
4:04
course to execute various command line commands obviously so the entire package
4:10
of server operating systems now remember at teana we do everything in depth not
4:18
on a shallow level but really properly with in-depth knowledge that's why the
4:23
boot cam also takes a little bit longer because we go into the detail and we do everything 10 10 times better than
4:30
anyone else so in the Linux module I actually wanted to teach you concepts of
4:36
operating systems not just Linux and one specific Distribution on Linux so I made
4:43
sure to use different Linux distributions with different package manager tools they use so you learn EPT
4:51
and yum and you know exactly how they compare and important thing here for me
4:57
is that by diversifying your knowledge you have much deeper understanding of
5:02
the concepts instead of being tied to individual tools and having knowledge of
5:07
a specific tool or distribution and only understanding that and as soon as it gets replaced and you have to deal with
5:14
a different one you kind of lose your track and you don't know what to do and that's why I always make sure that you
5:21
understand everything on a conceptual level first and then the implementation of it so in just two weeks you have
5:28
worked through the entire thing and laate the important foundation of your
5:33
devops engineering skills and in week two already started with Version Control
5:38
concepts with Git specifically so week two and three you learn two very
5:45
important Concepts version management with Git again concepts of why version
5:50
management is important and learn git as a specific implementation but not only
5:55
the basics of cloning and forking or creating repositories from scratch
6:00
because you can literally Google this stuff and learn pretty easily but also
6:06
things like resolving conflicts changing local git configuration lots of Hands-On work to understand the actual use cases
6:13
of git and we will actually be using git for the rest of the boot camp so this
6:19
chapter builds your skills if you've never worked with Git before or just
6:25
aren't as proficient and after that you'll be using git so so often throughout the next projects in the boot
6:32
camp it will just become basically second nature to you and it also happens to be a required skill for many devops
6:40
engineering jobs after G we get into build tools now this is an important
6:46
part but maybe a little scary for a lot of Engineers who have zero software
6:52
development knowledge but again we go step by step and indepth in learning
6:58
different packaging tools like npm for JavaScript Maven and Gradle for Java now
7:04
why is it important because as a devops engineer you'll be working very closely with software developers and often there
7:12
is this interface between software engineers and devops Engineers where they need to have a Common Language
7:18
especially as I said if you don't come from a software development background so packaging tools for applications is
7:25
one of the most important interfaces between developer and devops engineering team team especially when it comes to
7:31
building cicd pipelines so in this module you basically understand how
7:36
software developers work how they package their applications and how they
7:41
hand over then to the CD pipeline or to you as a devops engineered and that's
7:46
why learning this skill set is so important now why are we learning not
7:52
one but three packaging tools for two different programming languages that's
7:58
also very important part because again I want you not to be tied to one specific
8:04
tool or text deck I want you to really understand the concepts but not just
8:09
theoretically but in practice and in order to understand the concepts often
8:15
you need to work with two three alternative tools to really see the common patterns of how things work no
8:23
matter which programming language or text deck the developers are working with and that comparison that practice
8:29
iCal experience of comparing two three alternative tools and how they work gives you the confidence and in-depth
8:37
knowledge of knowing how to deal with this category of tasks so as you see you
8:44
learn even more than what most actual working devops Engineers are able to do
8:51
because as I said many devops Engineers who may come from system administrations or Cloud engineering or networking
8:57
background will definitely be lacking the skill which is very important for
9:02
properly working with the development team and that means by completing this
9:08
chapter you will literally have Superior knowledge to many working professionals
9:14
coming from non-ev background who don't know how this part works now very very
9:19
important we don't code here I provide simple applications Java and JavaScript
9:26
applications with ready code and we simply learn how to configure the
9:32
packaging and things around packaging that application because devops Engineers are not coders if you are
9:39
asked to code and write application as a devops engineer they are basically
9:45
asking you something that is absolutely beyond the scope of a devops role so
9:50
here even though we are working with the code we are actually using the ready application and we simply understand the
9:58
parts of the code that is relevant for us to configure the packaging and
10:03
building of applications written in any language or stack and another huge
10:09
differentiator of how I love to teach is we take Knowledge from the operating
10:15
system module the git module and use things we learned there now in the
10:21
context of packaging tools so you're learning and practicing these tools in
10:28
various context Tex for really deep all-rounded knowledge but obviously this
10:33
is just the beginning this is just part one of four of the devop boot camp and
10:39
this is actually the part that I call devops prerequisite or basically devops
10:44
Essentials in order to slowly build our knowledge to start creating these more complex endtoend devops projects that
10:52
come in part three and four so in week four we start with part two devops
10:58
fundamentals which starts with Cloud Basics which is a lightweight module so in one week we'll learn with practice of
11:05
course how to create a virtual machines on a Cloud Server how to configure firewall SSH into the server take our
11:12
packaged application from the previous week install all the needy tools on the server to run our application and then
11:19
copy and deploy our application on this Linux VM that we configured and also
11:24
very important to mention here if you have never done this before we go step by step through this entire demo so you
11:32
learn the essential concepts of VMS on the cloud and just demystify the entire
11:37
thing for you if you do know AWS or cloud in general and you have some
11:42
experience then this should really be a breeze for you to work through now this
11:48
is the cloud foundational knowledge later in the boot camp we get into the advanced stuff with AWS in part three
11:56
for complex use cases so this is to really get you started easily if you
12:03
really have zero knowledge and experience with Cloud so after that week four and five we dive into Nexus or
Month 2
12:10
artifact repository concept and as always we learned the underlying
12:16
concepts of what are the artifacts artifact repositories artifact repository managers we will see how to
12:23
publish different types of artifacts like jar files zip files doer images all
12:29
in one tool but we also learn the admin side of things how to install our own
12:35
Nexus server on cloud VM configure accesses with users and permissions
12:41
configure artifact storage even the cleanup policies and so on and of course for Automation and scripting we learn
12:48
how to use a Nexus API to upload download and view artifacts from the repositories in week five till 7 will
12:56
dedicate to Docker so here already we not only learn Docker with so many
13:02
important details that many people skip when teaching Docker we learn Docker
13:08
using all the previous tools that we learned in the boot camp so far so we
13:13
combine all the previous knowledge and learn Docker in the context of these different devops Technologies because in
13:20
devops everything is interconnected so it makes absolutely zero sense to learn
13:26
any devops technology in isolation without considering and using it with all the other devops tools now many
13:34
people ask what's the difference between Docker course or kubernetes course that we have on our YouTube channel from
13:41
what's in the dev boot camps Docker and kubernetes modules the answer is a lot
13:46
there's a lot more depth and Detail in the Devas bot cam which we simply cannot cover YouTube in a simple uh even four
13:54
five hour course it may seem like a lot to have four five hours of dockor or kubernetes but there is way more to
14:01
learn especially as I said when combining these tools with various other DeVos Technologies and building
14:07
complexos processes and that's what's covered in the devil's boot camp so we go much much deeper not only in Docker
14:14
and kuon themselves but we'll learn how to use this in combination with other devops tools like we use Docker to set
14:20
up all our um devops tools like Nexus and Jenkins we learn how to use Docker
14:26
in CSD pipelines in AWS environment with terraform with enable we dockerize
14:32
various applications for different use cases so outside of the docker module
14:37
itself we actually use Docker throughout the rest of the boot camp in all the following modules as well very
14:43
intensively and the boot camp scope and structure allows it so none of that
14:49
content is on YouTube because it's just much more complex and much more interconnected with all the other tools
14:56
and concepts with kubernetes it's even more so with tons of best practices and
15:01
advanced use cases which aren't even covered in the 5H hour kux course on
15:06
YouTube so we do have much of those five hours in the boot cam as well plus maybe
15:12
15 hours more of using cat in more advanced in production grade use cases
15:18
again combined with other tools so that should answer this very commonly asked
15:24
question so after concluding Docker module in week s this is where the
15:30
actual real real real fun and that crazy
15:36
valuable devops engineer skill building actually begins this is where we're taking our devops skills from devops
15:44
Junior to midlevel or senior engineer level with not only the tools and
15:51
Concepts but the complex detailed projects that we start building so in
15:57
week seven we start with part three of the boot camp which we call devops core
16:03
and not by accident you will be working on Jenkins module and building CSD
16:10
pipelines for over three weeks now I know that's a lot to dedicate on one
16:17
concept or tool but cicd is the backbone the literal core of devops like if you
16:23
strip away everything from a devops engineer down to one core skill that they need to possess it would be knowing
16:30
how to build fully automated cicd pipelines this also happens to be one of the most valuable pieces of Automation
16:38
in the entire software development life cycle so in week 8 till 10 of the devil's boot camp you will be learning
16:44
the Deep underlying concepts of build automation why it's important even the
16:50
whole history of evolution from simple build jobs to pipelines to multibranch
16:55
pipelines and so on and of course right after we dive in Hands-On practice in
17:01
fact 85% of this boot camp are actually demo projects so you're learning by
17:07
doing the entire time so in week 9 and 10 you're learning to write Jenkins file
17:13
groovy script for more flexible pipeline logic learning how to automate running
17:18
tests packaging applications which you learn in build tools module building and storing Docker images using the docker
17:25
Knowledge from the docker module connecting to git repository and configuring web hook to automatically trigger the
17:31
pipeline on code pushes to automatically increment release versions taging image
17:37
artifacts with unique Texs every time the build runs also creating Jenkins
17:42
shared Library project and making pipeline logic reusable for multiple
17:47
projects as you would do in real work scenarios now Jenkins is the most used C
17:54
tool in the industry and large companies they cannot just switch from Jenkins to KN one easily but as I mentioned the
18:02
knowledge is transferable if you can administer and manage Jenkins then it will be very easy for you to set up cicd
18:09
on other platforms like gitlab or GitHub actions the others are actually more high level and Abstract so you will have
18:15
deeper understanding of cicd platforms because Jenkins is a little bit more lowlevel and also when companies are
18:22
migrating to other platforms your knowledge will be much more valuable again but this is actually only the
18:28
usage side you also learned the administration part of Jenkins you learned how to set up the whole Jenkins
18:34
server from scratch yourself and administer it managing the server installing various tools on the server
18:41
configuring accesses to various platforms and integrating Jenkins with all the other tools and this is just the
18:47
beginning of the pipeline projects we actually add to this Pipeline and make
18:53
it more and more production grade and more complex with every following module and technology introduced in the boot
Month 3
19:00
camp so from week 10 we start with AWS and learn every single foundational
19:07
service of AWS how to create infrastructure with BMS various networking Services we learn access
19:14
management with IM service which is one of the most important ones for managing your AWS Cloud infrastructure and we use
19:22
that knowledge to extend our cicd pipeline from the Jenkins module and deploy to AWS infrastructure from the
19:29
Jenkins pipeline automatically we'll learn how to deploy from Jenkins to multiple deployment environments as in
19:35
real life like Dev testing and prod environments and again automating all
19:41
that with logic in Jenkins file script week 12 we dive into kubernetes and
Month 4
19:47
again to compare with what's on YouTube we start with fundamentals of kubernetes
19:53
but raise the level to diving into more and more in-depth and complex Dema
19:58
project so we build a custom help chart for a microservice application and deploy to
20:04
Cluster with best practices we also integrate Jenkins pipeline to deploy to kuet Cluster in multiple kubernetes
20:11
deployment environments and again we learn the usage and administration side
20:17
of kubernetes to basically cover the whole spectrum kubernetes is in fact one of the largest modules in the entire
20:24
DeVos boot camp which tells you how important it is to learn Cates but also how complex it is and how much time you
20:31
need to dedicate to really learn and understand kubernetes to a deeper level
20:37
and to culminate the devops core projects we take the knowledge of
20:43
Jenkins AWS and kubernetes and learn how to provision an e cluster really
20:51
understand the networking behind the roles and permissions applied the architecture of the cluster the eks
20:57
cluster specifically how it runs in the background configure autoscaling and deploy various add-ons
21:04
and then we again build a fully automated release Pipeline with the
21:10
skills we learned in git Linux Jenkins Docker AWS build tools basically all the
21:17
knowledge of previous modules culminating in this module as the next
21:22
large Capstone project with production grid configuration in fact many of our
21:29
students have directly used the Jenkins file and the whole configuration script
21:35
from this project directly at their work by just changing a few parameters
21:41
literally just integrating into their actual work projects and even explaining
21:46
and teaching the engineering colleagues how the whole configuration works now I believe it must be an amazing feeling
21:54
when you are the only one in the team who can build such complete into ende
22:00
devops process and I believe 16 weeks of learning for 15 hours a week is worth
22:09
investing to get to this level as an engineer and this is a onetime
22:14
investment of your life that will pay off for years after you can even check
22:20
out so many of our devops boot camp students who've had success in their
22:25
careers with this part alone the the skills that we cover in these four
22:30
modules we haven't even covered the part four the advanced Dev of skills yet so
22:35
if you stopped here and didn't do part four right away you would already be
22:40
Miles Ahead in your career and in what you can now do with these real life skills for your team or your company but
22:48
as I said we made this boot camp to train Engineers to become absolute best top-notch professionals and that's why
22:56
we have the whole part four devops advanced in this boot camp and
23:02
interestingly these are often skills that are only expected from senior
23:07
devops Engineers so if you're a junior devops engineer these skills will speed up your career growth to senior level
23:15
like nothing else will now you will notice that the entire part four is
23:22
dedicated to tools that are predominantly about automating everything and we have even different
23:29
tools for different automating use cases so you learn not only one but three
23:34
automation tools and how they compare and as a highly skilled professional
23:40
with all these tools in your tool belt you will know exactly which tool to whip
23:45
out for what task and automate literally anything you want to automate in your systems this is not an easy task that's
23:53
why often senior devops Engineers are tested with this but you learn how to to
23:58
do it here in this part of the boot camp so we start with terraform in week 17 and this is actually the largest most
Month 5
24:06
heavy module in the entire boot camp you know why not because of terraform it's
24:12
because we literally now take everything we learned in every single module before
24:17
and architect it all together with full complete automation from provisioning
24:24
infrastructure and CET clusters to building and deploying applications to
24:29
the cluster via a release pipeline so after we learn terraform from zero to advanced level we automate the entire
24:37
process end to endend and this is probably the largest Capstone project in
24:42
the boot camp so week 17 to week 20 for four weeks straight you are reusing and
24:51
perfecting all your newly learned devop skills from the entire boot camp with
24:56
Advanced use cases so this chapter prepares you to absolutely crush it in
25:03
any DeVos position you start working in like I'm not even talking about job interviews because I think we're already
25:09
past that point of understanding that these devop skills will literally get you past any devops interview we have
25:17
students who told us stories of how the interviewers asked them where they learn
25:23
all these things and how they knew the tools and Concepts so well without having devops experience I guess they
25:30
couldn't imagine that an educational program can give you such a profound
25:35
level of knowledge in such complex topics because most of the educational programs don't give you that and that's
25:41
why everyone's shocked with the level of knowledge that we prepare our engineering students with but that's not
Month 6
25:48
all devop is all about automation right there may be small tasks you may want to
25:55
automate that aren't infrastructure related and that's why many devop jobs
26:00
actually require python or some kind of scripting language skills and if you
26:06
have never written a line of code before even if you have never seen a line of
26:11
code before the Python Programming module will teach you all the
26:17
programming skills you need for a Devo engineer and then with that knowledge
26:23
you will learn how to automate devops tasks with python and most most importantly you will see several real
26:31
world use cases of what devops and software development or operational tasks you can automate with python again
26:39
as I said all of these are really on top like bonus knowledge it's like leveling
26:44
up in a game so by the end of eks module you already have a strong character you
26:51
are equipped with all the powerful stuff now starting from terraform with every
26:56
next skill you you are basically adding to your superpowers layer after layer
27:02
just becoming unbeatable so week 23 we dive into enable you understand
27:10
all the concepts and basics in the simplest way possible as always and then we get right into writing playbooks and
27:18
an important note here is that often people teach different tools with
27:24
examples which are detached from the real project scenarios so you learn the
27:29
syntax of a tool and configuration like you know anible modules and how to use them but you sitting there
27:37
wondering okay so now what do I do with this tool like where do I actually use
27:42
it what value do I get from using this tool so you haven't learned the
27:49
important part about the tool which is the Practical use cases of when and how
27:54
to use it which is very important and just like in every every single module starting from the Linux one every demo
28:02
that I cover is an actual project that you would do at a real work so you not
28:09
only know anible but you know at least 20 different specific use cases where enable can be used and since you already
28:17
learned terraform and python I explained the differences between use cases of all
28:23
three like why do we have three automation tools why can't we just use ter form for everything or use Python
28:30
for everything so those subtle details that usually come from work experience
28:35
that no program will teach you I wanted to have hundreds of those details in the
28:41
entire program and we see what effect that kind of training has from the
28:46
Abundant success stories of our boot camp graduates and students but we are
28:53
still not quite done here one last chapter which is automatic monitoring
28:59
and alerting with promethus alert manager and gratic now probably if you get this far
29:06
your career has already so taken off that you don't even need this part which
29:11
again happens all the time with our students they usually already find a devops job or level up in their existing
29:18
role by the time they even come this far but again there are a few of you who are
29:24
just motivated to keep learning who have Ambitions and really want to be the
29:29
absolute best at what you do in fact if you check out devops job descriptions
29:35
this skill set is almost always listed as a nice to have or optional one like
29:41
even though it's so important companies don't even list it as a requirement because most Engineers don't have this
29:46
knowledge it's also a pretty complex skill set like it's not easy to learn this so it's super valuable almost no
29:52
Engineers have the skill and it's complex but you know what the best news is
29:58
I actually managed to cover here real life complex scenarios of monitoring
30:05
different parts of the system but do it in the simplest most understandable way
30:12
possible like I guarantee you even if you have never even heard the word monitoring before you will be able to
30:19
follow the demo projects here step by step without any friction this is
30:24
probably the smoothest set of lectures in the High boot camp so in weeks 25 and
30:31
26 you will be becoming Unstoppable with this last piece of advanced devops skill
30:39
set so that's the detailed walk through of the entire devops road map that's how
30:46
much you are getting out of this program and I will tell you with confidence of
30:52
having trained already thousands of Engineers for The Last 5 Years and getting the most amazing feedback from
30:59
them there is no other program literally nothing comparable to this that can give
31:05
you this level of knowledge honestly I don't know why other programs and other
31:12
educators are not able to deliver the same quality and same level of knowledge
31:19
that we do but I guess we just know how to teach 100 times better than anyone
31:24
else does so with this as I said you can grab this weekly schedule for Learning
31:31
devops and use it as a guide regardless of whether you enroll in our DeVos Boot
31:36
Camp or you decide to learn yourself enjoy until next video
